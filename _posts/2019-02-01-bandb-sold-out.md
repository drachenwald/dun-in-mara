Coronet of Fools is currently sold out of double rooms. Bunk beds in dorms are still available, as are family rooms, and camping and day trip tickets.

If you wish to day trip and seek alternative accommodation off site, the nearest B&B is [Dalyâ€™s Inn, Donore](http://dalysofdonore.com), about 2km from the site.

If you would like to join a waiting list for B&B rooms, please contact the reservation steward at [coronetreservations@duninmara.org](mailto:coronetreservations@duninmara.org).
