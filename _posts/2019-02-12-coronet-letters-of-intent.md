Those who would rule, hear me! A great tournament will take place in May near Newgrange, and the winners will become the next rulers of Insulae Draconis. Their Highnesses call on those who would fight, and those who would inspire them to fight, to submit their Letters of Intent at the earliest opportunity.

Couples who wish to enter may submit their letter of intent at [the Insulae Draconis website](http://insulaedraconis.org/Coronet/CoronetTourney.html).

The tourney will take place on May 11th 2019 at [Coronet of Fools](/events/2019/coronet).
