The closure of schools and public institutions from today has affected most of the venues we use for our fighting, fencing, archery and A&S practices. We will therefore cancel all practices for two weeks: from today, 12 March 2020, until 27 March 2020. We will continue to review this in line with Irish government advice over the coming period. Please check back at this website for up to date information.

At this time, our events Cruinni√∫ and Tavern of Fools <i>are still scheduled</i>. We are following <a href="https://www.gov.ie/en/press-release/96eb4c-statement-from-the-national-public-health-emergency-team/">Irish government advice</a> for dealing with COVID-19. Both our events are well below the government's limit of 100 people for gatherings, and the venue we are using is very conducive to social distancing protocols, including separate bedrooms and bathrooms for groups of 2-3 people. While we will of course watch the advice from the government and medical authorities closely, we are still looking forward to welcoming you to both events.
