We plan to open registration very soon (hooray!), but before we do, we want to share a little bit more information about booking our camping pods. These camping pods are an excellent budget option for tickets. The site has four camping pods and each can sleep 4 adults. You could squeeze in 5 if one or two in the group are children. You can find more details about them in our ‘<a href="https://duninmara.org/posts/2023/11/30/crown-accom/">Accommodation Options at Spring Crown</a>’. 

The pods are small, so we recommend that if you are interested in staying in one that you gather a group of 3-5 and register all together. Once your booking is confirmed, a pod will be reserved for your group. 

Of course, you are still welcome to book a single ticket for a camping pod, but we cannot guarantee that you will have the space to yourself. We will group single bookings together in a pod to ensure that we use every available bed space and allow as many people as possible to attend our event. 

Thank you for your understanding, and if you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact myself or Dame Sela, as the co-event stewards, at SpringCrown@DuninMara.org
