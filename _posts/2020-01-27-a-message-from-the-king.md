_For Cruinniú, we will feature a series of short posts from fighters around the Kingdom about what inspired them to fight, or things they've learned about armoured combat._

_We are honoured to present this post from His Majesty, King Æiríkr inn Hárfagri._

Greetings Drachenwald and especially those attending Cruinniú!

When I was asked to write what fighting means to me, it was a difficult task. Fighting means a lot but how to put it into words is not easy. Fighting means joy, competition and striving for perfection even though I know I will never reach it. It also means to always stay humble since there is always something new to learn and those lessons can be taught by anyone – like when my squire successfully used my own technique against me! Don't view losing a fight as a failure; look at it as an opportunity to learn something new. Challenge yourself always, constantly, in the list field and outside of it.

And finally, a lesson that really stuck with me is more of a question to ask every now and then: "Do you want to be a knight or do you want to be knighted?"

In service of the Kingdom and the Dream,  
Æríkr
