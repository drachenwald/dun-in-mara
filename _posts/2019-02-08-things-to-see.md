Ireland is full of historical places and things to see. If you're visiting for [Coronet of Fools](/events/2019/coronet), we hope that you can extend your stay for a few days and visit some of them.

Obviously, we’re right next door to the [Brú na Bóinne visitors centre](http://www.heritageireland.ie/en/midlands-eastcoast/brunaboinnevisitorcentre/) which provides tours both of Newgrange and of nearby Knowth.

Not so far away - about 30 minutes by car - is the [Hill of Tara](http://www.heritageireland.ie/en/midlands-eastcoast/hilloftara/), the ancient site of the High Kings in Ireland. (We thought about investing the new Prince and Princess there, but decided not to take the chance of it being misconstrued by the authorities...)

Dublin has a wealth of museums and other things to see. For our scribal friends, we'd particularly like to recommend the [Chester Beatty Library](https://chesterbeatty.ie/) which contains a truly astonishing collection of manuscripts and books. And, of course, you can visit the [Long Room in Trinity College](https://www.tcd.ie/visitors/book-of-kells/tickets-information/) and take a look at the Book of Kells while you're there.

If you'd like to travel a bit further for some beautiful scenery, [Glendalough](http://www.glendalough.ie/) is really one of our favourite places. Consider following one of the [walking trails](https://www.wicklowmountainsnationalpark.ie/recreation/walking-trails/) while you're there.

And all of that is within about 50km of Dublin! There's much more if you'd like to go further and stay a bit longer. Check out our [travel guide]({% link events/2019/coronet/travel.md %}) particularly if you'd like to bring a car; the event site is only 45 minutes drive once you get off the ferry. And, if you book quickly, it might be cheaper than you think too - Irish Ferries has a [flash sale for 25% off](https://www.irishferries.com/ie-en/offers/25off-flashsale-Ireland/) over this weekend.
