Hear ye, hear ye!
'Tis that time of year when our hearts yearn for longer evenings, slightly less rain, and frolicking (or fighting) on castle grounds (or is that just your humble Chronicler?). 
Yes good gentlefolk, you have guessed it. Strawberry raid approaches! 
The event team is delighted to announce that bookings have officially opened! Please go to the [dedicated event page here](/events/2026/strawberry-raid-v/index.md) to find the booking link.

We hope to see you there!
