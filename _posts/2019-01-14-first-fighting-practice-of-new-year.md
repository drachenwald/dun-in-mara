Dun In Mara's first armoured combat practice today was attended by six hardy, devoted souls, five of whom reported various levels of seasonal illness. Hence there was no actual armour, and more slightly glazed expressions than normally. There were drills designed to work on creating openings and making use of those, as well as drills to practice flow, and as a a counter, minimal blocking. Lots of basic slow work, too. We finished early due to the overall lack of mental and physical resources, but are looking forward to coming weeks of hopefully better health! Do come along and [join us](/armoured-fighting).
