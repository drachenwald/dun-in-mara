It is that time of the year again. In less than two weeks we shall determine the next Champions of Lough Devnaree!

While the honour of organising and hosting the event goes to our dear neighbours of Eplaheimr, we of Dun in Mara have the honour of participating. 

The categories are as follows: 
- Arts & Sciences 
- Arts & Sciences Youth
- Archery
- Armoured Combat
- Fencing

Our most esteemed Tomás Ó Griobhtha who is the current A&S champion has already set the challenge for the competition: this year's theme is rain. Entries can be anything that invokes rain, be it in colour, shape, or design elements. 


Pre-booking is essential. [Book here](https://fienta.com/champions-of-lough-devnaree)

The site is moderately accessible, with some bumpy doorways.

Event co-stewards: Baroness Melisende Fitzwalter & Ildanach Orlaith Chaomhanach  
Marshal in Charge: TBC
Food Co-ordinator: Máistir Aodh O'Siadhail
Competition Co-ordinators: Current reigning Champions
