Fencers! Good news ahead ;) We are approaching the end of Fiore's zogho largo (wide or free plays), so it is time to get into some serious business and beat each other up a bit (with all due safety precautions!).

Inspired by Guy Windsor's Tempest class, this time we are approaching the material a bit differently. We start with a short lesson on body structure; then drill some locks and movements as an unarmed defense against dagger attacks. Finally, we are going to see how these concepts translate to complete longsword plays.

Due to the length of the material we expect this will span two consecutive lessons. [More on our fencing classes...](/historical-fencing)
