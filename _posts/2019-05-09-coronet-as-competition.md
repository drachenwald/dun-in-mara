Coronet of Fools is almost upon is and with that it is time to show what wondrous arts and sciences our great principality has to offer.

With it being Coronet Tourney, the theme for the arts and sciences competition is **colour and splendor**, so grab your projects that you've been working on and show your great efforts to the rest of the principality. Competition will be decided by popular choice. Please hand your projects to Lady Kytte of the Lake at the event to log each entry.

For those who do not wish to enter the competition but still wish to show their projects, there will also be a display area.
