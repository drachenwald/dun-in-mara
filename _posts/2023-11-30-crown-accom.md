Now that we have announced pricing for our Spring Crown Tournament, we wanted to share a little bit more information about what each ticket includes so that you can choose the ticket that is best for you!

**Adult, weekend, bunk bed — €85.** This ticket is good for one adult SCA member for the entire event! All of your meals will be provided, including travellers fare Friday night, breakfast, lunch and a delicious feast cooked by Aodh Ó Siadhail on Saturday, and breakfast on Sunday morning. You will have a bunk bed in one of the dorm rooms with all bedding provided (pillow, sheets, duvet), and toilet and shower facilities in the building where you are sleeping. You’ll need to bring your own towel. 

**Adult, camping pod — €50.** This ticket is also good for one adult SCA member for the entire event! Just like the above option, all meals are provided, including the feast. The difference is in your sleeping arrangements. The camping pods are small wooden permanent structures with raised platforms around the sides and back walls where you can sit or set up your bed for the night. We have been told that there is enough height for most people to be able to stand up straight in the middle of the pods. You will need to bring an air mattress and all of your own bedding for a comfortable night’s sleep. This option would be good for a close group of 4 friends to book together, as we are told it’s very cosy inside! Toilets and shower facilities are located in a separate building. You’ll need to bring your own towel. 

**Adult, camping in own tent — €35.** For the brave SCAdians who want to gamble with the Irish spring weather! All of your meals, including feast, are provided and you will have access to toilet and shower facilities, although you need to bring your own towel. You will also need to bring your own tent, bedding, and anything else you need to sleep comfortably outside. 

**Day trip — €30.** This ticket is perfect for any adult SCA member who wants to come along for Saturday (and Friday evening if you’re free!) and enjoy all the delicious meals for the day, including feast. You won’t have anywhere to sleep on site, so this option is best if you live nearby or have booked into a hotel or BnB. Toilet facilities are, of course, available for use all through the event.
