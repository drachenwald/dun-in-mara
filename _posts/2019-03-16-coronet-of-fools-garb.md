Coronet of Fools is just eight weeks away! The theme of this event is the wonder and magic of Faerie, and we encourage anyone who wishes to dress the part. If you're wondering what to do or how we do it, we can help.

If you're looking for inspiration for the rest of your garb, Thora Greylock has set up a Pinterest board with a ton of awesome ideas:
