Payment by bank transfer is now working for Coronet of Fools. We've addressed the problem where only credit cards were accepted; apologies if you were affected by this, and many thanks to those who let us know.

To pay by bank transfer from Ireland or the UK, choose the "Regular invoice" tab when you get to payment. (Don't use "Bank and credit card" - this only supports bank transfer in certain other countries.) We still have a few bunk beds available, as well as family rooms, day trip and camping spots, so [head to our booking page](/events/2019/coronet/registration) to secure your place.
