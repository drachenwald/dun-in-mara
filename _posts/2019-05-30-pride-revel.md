Dun in Mara is going to Dublin Pride! And we would love for all of our friends, regardless of how you identify, to join us and show support.

### The March

Shortly after noon (time TBC) on 29 June 2019, we will gather in O'Connell St to take part in the Dublin Pride March. We plan to march in our garb, and feel free to decorate it with rainbows or blue feathers. We'll have further info on the details for gathering, and what's allowed to be brought with us, in due course.

If you'd like to march with us, please let us know on [the Facebook event for the march](https://www.facebook.com/events/2244550275635986/) (or send an email to chronicler@duninmara.org if you're not on Facebook.)

### The Revel

After the march, we'll be at the Pride Village in Merrion Square for a while. From about 17:00, we'll head over to [The Workshop Gastropub](https://goo.gl/maps/4YEUeJWbwK9cwbQY6) where we have the upstairs room to ourselves. Food will be provided. Entry is FREE - we'll just ask for a small contribution toward the cost of food.

If you're curious about the SCA but haven't been able to come to one of our events, we would be delighted if you'd drop in and join us for a while.

If you plan to join us, please let us know on [the Facebook event for the revel](https://www.facebook.com/events/689001048247532/) even if you're already marked as going to the march (or send an email to chronicler@duninmara.org if you're not on Facebook.)

See you at Pride! üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà
