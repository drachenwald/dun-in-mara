We are absolutely thrilled with the response to Cruinniú. There's been so much interest that bookings are coming quite quickly, and we only have a limited number of bunk spaces left. If you'd like to attend and stay in a bed on site, please get your booking in soon.

We do still have plenty of space to camp and a number of crash space spots, and if you'd prefer to stay offsite, we have information on [other accommodation options](/events/2020/cruinniu/location) within walking or driving distance of the site.
