We are blown away by the response to Cruinniú. As of today, all of our indoor sleeping space is fully booked. Don't despair if you still want to attend, though.

We still of course have space for camping, and if you're coming from a distance there are a [number of B&Bs](/events/2020/cruinniu/location) varying distances from the site. Meals are provided for all attendees, regardless of where you sleep.

We will also free up beds as and when cancellations come in, so if you'd like to stay on site, please contact the event steward at [cruinniu@duninmara.org](mailto:cruinniu@duninmara.org) as soon as possible.

If you wish to cancel, please also [contact the event steward](mailto:cruinniu@duninmara.org).

To everyone who has booked, thank you again. We're looking forward to an amazing event.
