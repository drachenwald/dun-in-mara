We are deeply sorry to announce that Cruinniú will be postponed due to the COVID-19 situation. Given the extraordinary measures being taken by countries across Europe and North America, and to protect our families, friends, and all other people in our society (and Society), we have unfortunately had to make the very difficult decision to postpone Cruinniú to a later stage in the year.

We have sent an email to all registered attendees with further information on next steps, including refunds. When we have further information, we will update this website.

Our fighting, fencing, archery and A&S practices remain cancelled untill 27 March due to the closure of schools and public institutions, which has affected most of the venues we use. We will continue to review this in line with Irish government advice over the coming period. Please check back at this website for up to date information.

At this time, <b>Tavern of Fools is still scheduled for 29 May-1 June 2020</b>. We are following <a href="https://www.gov.ie/en/press-release/96eb4c-statement-from-the-national-public-health-emergency-team/">Irish government advice</a> for dealing with COVID-19. The event is well below the government's limit of 100 people for gatherings, and the venue we are using is very conducive to social distancing protocols, including separate bedrooms and bathrooms for groups of 2-3 people. We will of course watch the advice from the government and medical authorities closely, and update this website as the situation changes.
