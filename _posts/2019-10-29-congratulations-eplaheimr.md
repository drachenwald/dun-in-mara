Our good friends in Eplaheimr have shared the very happy news that they are to become a barony next summer! This is a large undertaking, and we at Dun in Mara would like to congratulate them on this major accomplishment.

The culmination of this (and, we expect, a giant celebration) will be [Eplaheimr's first Baronial Investiture](https://www.eplaheimr.org/Events/baronialinvestiture.html) which is scheduled to take place in July next year. We're looking forward to this wonderful occasion, and to supporting Eplaheimr in any way we can.
