Greetings from your friendly neighbourhood Cruinniú Event Steward. I wanted to take a moment to encourage everyone to think about your fellow SCAdians who are without a doubt the most amazing bunch of people.

Think about that act of kindness or that moment of martial prowess that made you smile and reminded you why you spend hours traveling, have a Masters in car packing, and regularly thank people for hitting you over the head.  Now transmute that feeling into action and recommend the gentle for an award.

Since it's a time to give gifts, take a look at these links, including the Kingdom Order of Precedence - just to make sure the object of your recommendation doesn’t already have the honour that you are planning to recommend them for.
