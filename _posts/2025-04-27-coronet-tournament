Join us for the Insulae Draconis Coronet at [Strawberry Raid IV](/events/2025/strawberry-raid-iv/) and a panoply of delightful activities. 

This year at Strawberry Raid, Prince Alexander and Princess Agnes will be hosting the Coronet Tournament to determine the next highnesses of Insulae Draconis. 

The event will feature Duke Conor Weisszahn as the armoured combat trainer. As well as fencing, archery, and thrown weapons. 

Or steep yourself in ‘Creating Colours’ this year’s theme for Arts & Sciences. Be prepared to ring around the cauldron as we attempt to achieve a rainbow of historical, naturally-dyed colours.  
Many other arts & sciences classes will be available to sign up for and participate in.

The event will also host a Laurel Prize Display, for all who would like to display their creations or research. Followed by a lovely Market where interested parties can sell their wares to appreciative shoppers. 

We welcome you to Strawberry Raid at Sigginstown Castle from Wednesday 28th of May through Monday 2nd of June.  
Be prepared for festivity, artistry, and comradery during the day, and merriment and the Wexford sky at night.  
Bookings close on 21st May. 

You can book and get more details on the event page.
