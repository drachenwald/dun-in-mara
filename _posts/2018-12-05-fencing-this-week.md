Yesterday, longsworders practiced a safer way of not getting stabbed: the breaking of the thrust. Then we learned that with enough skills and timing, you can get out of what looks like a dire situation and unexpectedly win the bout! Next week we'll continue on this play. Come see who gets stabbed next!

Meanwhile, the Rapier fencers worked on some grapples from Fabris.
