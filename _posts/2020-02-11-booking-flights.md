Cruinniú is now a little over two months away. If you're planning to fly to Ireland for the event, we find that this is usually a opportune time to start finding good value flights. Dublin Airport is very well served by a variety of low cost airlines with flights all over Europe.

Regardless of how you're travelling, check out our [travel guide](/events/2020/cruinniu/travel) for how to get to the venue by air, ferry, road and rail.

If you think you're no longer going to be able to make it, then that makes us really sad! Our [cancellation policy](/about/cancellation) means you can get a full refund if you let us know at least two weeks ahead of the event. Since our beds are fully booked, however, we'd really appreciate if you could let us know as soon as you can, because that might give another person the chance to attend and book their travel at a reasonable rate.

And if you find a good deal for travel, [let us know on Facebook!](https://www.facebook.com/events/2383242761923872/)

Oh, and don't forget - if you stay for the week, you can attend [Flaming Arrow](/events/2020/cruinniu/flaming-arrow) as well.
