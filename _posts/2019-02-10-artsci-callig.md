At our scribal themed A&S meetup tonight, Anneleyn practiced Gothic Littera Bastarda based on the Marc Drogin book. Delighted shouts of “the g looks a g” could be heard. Jasper tried out the basic calligraphy set he got and then tested Windsor & Newton ink and decided to get himself some at Evans Art Supplies off Capel St. Alays started doing the illumination of a Manesse initial on a blank scroll, which she had traced a while back. And Duncan worked diligently on a secret project that we are not allowed to talk about. There might also have been tea.

We are planning to do another scribal A&S soon.
