Their Highnesses grow weary of the burdens of the Crown. Of those who compete in the great tournament near Newgrange, one couple will be invested as the new rulers of the Dragon Isles. If you wish to participate, you must notify their Highnesses at least one month before the tourney, no later than 11th April 2019. Couples who wish to enter may submit their letter of intent at [the Insulae Draconis website](http://insulaedraconis.org/Coronet/CoronetTourney.html).

The tourney will take place on 11th May 2019 at [Coronet of Fools](/events/2019/coronet).
