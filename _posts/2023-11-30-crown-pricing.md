There's something important about pricing for this event that we'd like to note.

You may be aware that our affiliate organisation, that arranges our insurances, had to make some changes this year to make sure that we're covered. In particular, we need to pay a daily insurance surcharge for non-members to attend events. Now that's fine; we've already been working like this for a couple of months, and we have a good system in place to make sure that any SCA member, of any affiliate, is covered.

Here's the thing: for this event, the surcharge we'd have to add for non-members is almost as much as the cost of joining SCA UK/Ireland for a year. We don’t feel great about just adding that charge without offering the benefits of an annual membership -- not to mention that, by omitting it, we can make reservations a lot simpler for everyone.

So our thinking is that we'll ask **everyone attending the tournament** to be an up-to-do-date, paid **member** of the SCA or any affiliated group. If you're in the UK or Ireland, you can join at [https://membermojo.co.uk/scauk](https://membermojo.co.uk/scauk) for £15. Links to the affiliates for Finland, Sweden and elsewhere are at [https://www.sca.org/join-us/](https://www.sca.org/join-us/).

If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact Katie or myself as the co-event stewards at [springcrown@duninmara.org](mailto:springcrown@duninmara.org)
