At last, Coronet of Fools is just one day away. We will feast, we will have fun, and most importantly we will welcome our new Prince and Princess, or Princess and Princess, of Insulae Draconis. As you do your last minute packing and prepare to travel, these are some of the things we've talked about over the last few months.
