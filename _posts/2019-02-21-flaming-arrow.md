Why travel to just one event when you could come for two? The weekend before Coronet of Fools, the shire of Glen Rathlin will host [Flaming Arrow](http://glenrathlin.org/html/announce/events/flamingarrow.htm), the premier event in the Kingdom for archery. This takes place at the ASPIRE Centre in Clara, just 90 minutes from Newgrange Lodge (and 75 minutes from Dublin.)

Flaming Arrow always books out quickly, but as of the time of posting they do still have a few beds left, so if you plan to come, [book soon](http://glenrathlin.org/html/announce/events/flamingarrow.htm). And if you've not yet booked for Coronet of Fools, [we still have some beds left too](/events/2019/coronet/registration).

For the week in between (which includes the May bank holiday in Ireland and the UK) there are many [ways to spend your time](/events/2019/coronet/in-the-area) and [things to see]({% post_url 2019-02-08-things-to-see %}) in Ireland.
