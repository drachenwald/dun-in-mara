Tonight, for one night only! The annual Dun in Mara Kris Kindle Tournament Extravaganza!!! (Fanfare and cannon offstage)

All fencers will fence everybody, in whatever weapon combinations they can agree, subject to their gear and experience. This is a practice tournament, to help people prepare for tourneys at events. So you don't need to be authorised to fence, just safe (in the opinion of the marshals). 

Those who want to bring a small Kris Kindle gift, can then choose a gift after the tournament, in order of their scores.
