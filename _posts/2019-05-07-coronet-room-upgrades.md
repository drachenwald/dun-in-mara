Coronet of Fools is _three days away_ and we can't wait to welcome you! Having finalised registrations, we have a small number of beds in 2 or 3 person rooms which we can make available for upgrades on the day, first come first served. If you have booked a bunk bed and would like to upgrade to a B&B room, you can do this on the door for â‚¬50 per person, as long as they remain available.
