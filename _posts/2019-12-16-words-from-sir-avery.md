_For Cruinniú, we will feature a series of short posts from fighters around the Kingdom about what inspired them to fight, or things they've learned about armoured combat._

_Our first post is from Sir Avery Westfall._

My first SCA gathering was a rapier practice in someone's garden. An armoured fighter named Uisdeann had been asked to give a class on how to use a baton to parry rapiers with, "Because I guess they think armored fighters know how to use a stick?"

He was amiable, friendly, and gifted with martial arts. When I asked him, "Who would win a duel between a knight with a sword and shield or a samurai with a spear?” he replied, "I don't know... Let's find out!”

From that moment on, I was in.
