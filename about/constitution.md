*The SCA is an international organisation dedicated to researching and re-creating the arts and skills of pre-17th century Europe. Our “Known World” consists of 19 kingdoms, with over 30,000 members residing in countries around the world. Members, dressed in clothing of the Middle Ages and Renaissance attend events which feature tournaments, royal courts, feasts, dancing, various classes & workshops, and more.*

This is the constitution of the Shire of Dun in Mara, in the Principality of Insulae Draconis, of the Kingdom of Drachenwald. The constitution of the shire will be subject to the higher laws of principality, kingdom, and corpora.

The Dun in Mara AGM will be held annually, to review the constitution and any vacant officer positions.

**1. Bank Details**

[Bank Details can be requested from the Exchequer or the Seneschal]

The Dun in Mara banking details will be maintained on a private copy of the Dun in Mara Constitution, but will not be published on the Dun in Mara website.

**2. Financial Policy**

The Finance Committee is a body responsible for deciding on any expenditures made by the Shire. It consists of the Seneschal, the Exchequer and at least one other officer. Three members of the committee, including the Seneschal and Exchequer, shall be the signatories on the Shire’s bank account. The account should be set up so that two signatures shall be required for all account payments or withdrawals etc.

Decisions on expenditures should be made by consensus of all members of the Committee. In a case of impossibility to come to consensus, such expenditures shall be discussed and voted on by majority at the Shire Meeting. All members of the Committee shall be well informed and aware of all expenditures, both up to date and planned.

Every member of the Finance Committee should take an active part in necessary discussions and make their points clear.

**3. Voting within Dun in Mara**

Definitions:

A member is a person with current and up-to-date SCA membership.

A non-member is a person affiliated with the SCA but without paid membership.

All Dun in Mara SCA members will be able to take part in all votes.

Dun in Mara non-members can take part in all voting, with the exception of a vote of no confidence, provided they meet the following criteria – that they have attended at least 3 practices or 2 events in the last 6 months.

A motion of no confidence can only be taken at an official Shire Meeting if a majority of shire members agree to it based on previous discussion, and the officer in question has been failing in their duties through neglect for a period of no less than 3 quarters during their term. Failure in duty will depend on the nature of the office in question, in general reports must be submitted on time and the officer must make some contribution regularly to the activities that fall under the purview of their offices. Assistance will be granted to the officer to enable them to maintain their office, but if no improvement is seen during this time, a formal warning will be given to the officer after 3 quarters have elapsed. If the officer does not take up their duties after this warning, the vote of no confidence will be held in the next quarter.

Votes by proxy can be allowed at the discretion of the chairperson of the meeting. The format of the votes by proxy must be outlined by the chairperson at the time of the announcement of the vote. Proxy votes will be included for the determination of quorum, which will be either 50% of paid members or five (5) paid members, whichever is lower. Quorum will only be required for elections, constitutional changes, and votes of no confidence.

Persons running for election must submit an email to the seneschal or chairperson listing the post they are running for and their SCA membership number.

The format of the vote for elections will be as follows:

Where more than one candidate goes forward:

- Candidate A
- Candidate B
- None of the above
- Abstain

Where only one candidate goes forward:

- Candidate Z
- None of the above
- Abstain

All votes marked ABSTAIN will not count towards the majority.

A vote for NONE OF THE ABOVE is treated as a separate candidate.

The votes will be counted by the seneschal (unless a candidate) and another non-candidate.

In the result of a majority vote for “none of the above”, the candidate will be deemed unsuccessful, and the post shall remain vacant.

In the result of a vote for “abstain”, that is, all votes abstain and no other votes are cast, the vote shall be postponed until the following meeting. If the second vote occurs with “abstain” as a result, the candidate shall be deemed unsuccessful, and the post shall remain vacant.

In the result of the above votes for the posts of Seneschal or Exchequer, the previous holder of the post shall continue in officer until a successor is elected.

All ballots will be held as secret votes, unless otherwise specified. Proxy votes will be kept secret by the proxy holder.

*4. Officers’ term of office*

The term of an SCA officer of Dun in Mara shall be two years from the time of election. Election will be decided by a majority vote of all members and non-members as outlined above. Notification of elections must be given at least one month before the election is due to take place, to allow for the receipt of nominations.

An officer may choose to step down before their two year term is completed. If this occurs, elections will be held as normal to find a replacement for the office.

If an officer leaves office suddenly (e.g. due to death, illness or abdication), for the posts of Seneschal and Exchequer, the post shall revert to the previous office holder until an election can be held. In the case of other posts, the office shall be deemed vacant and can be filled by regular election process.

When an officer’s term is completed, they will be considered to have stepped down at this time. If they wish to run again, they will have to nominate themselves for election. Officer terms will not continue to run after term without election.

The only exceptions to this are the posts of Seneschal and Exchequer. As these posts are essential to shire status, these posts must remain filled until a successor is elected. In addition, if the number of officers falls to only three officers, this rule shall also apply to the third office.

The process for the nomination and election of a new officer shall be as follows:

No less than one month before the officers’ term is complete, the seneschal shall contact them privately to remind them of the end of their term and notify them of the upcoming election. Notification of the upcoming election, with a minimum of one months notice, must then be circulated to the populace. On receipt of candidates for the post, these shall be announced to the populace no less than one week before the election is due to be held, with notice if vote by proxy is to be allowed and the format of the proxy vote. Proxy votes shall be held by the seneschal or chair person for the purpose of the vote.
