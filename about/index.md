The Society for Creative Anachronism is an international group dedicated to recreating the Middle Ages - selectively!

Dun in Mara is the SCA shire covering the east and southeast of Ireland. We’re mostly centred around Dublin city and its surrounding areas, but open to everyone in our catchment area.

Among other things, we practice:

* Medieval Arts & Crafts
* Period Cookery & Brewing
* Heraldry & Arms
* Armoured Combat
* Medieval & Renaissance Fencing
* Archery
* Chivalry & Courtesy

If you're putting on a historical event, and you'd like us to appear there, get in touch!

We are part of the Society for Creative Anachronism (SCA), an international historical selective recreation group covering history up to 1600AD. You can read more about the SCA on the [society website](http://www.sca.org/links/about.html).

Right now, you can also find us on:

Dun in Mara is part of [Lough Devnaree](http://loughdevnaree.org/) (Ireland and Northern Ireland), belongs to the principality of [Insulae Draconis](http://insulaedraconis.org/) (Ireland, Northern Ireland, Great Britain and Iceland) and the kingdom of [Drachenwald](http://drachenwald.sca.org/) (Europe, South Africa, the Middle East and Russia).

If you’re interested in the SCA in this area, you can see a list of [officers](/contact/). Get in touch, and we’ll be happy to help get you started!

If you’re not in the east coast area, you might be covered by our neighbours in [Eplaheimr](http://eplaheimr.org), or in Northern Ireland by the Shire of [Glen Rathlin](http://glenrathlin.org). If you’re not in any of those areas, get in touch regardless – there may be a group starting up in your area.
