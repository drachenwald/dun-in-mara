title: Cancellation policy
---

This policy will apply to all events run by the Shire of Dun in Mara. It may be waived at the sole discretion of the Event Steward on a case by case basis. This policy is necessary to make sure that we can pay our food and site bills for events!

Attendance may be cancelled up to two weeks before the event with no penalty.

Attendance may be cancelled between two weeks and one week before the event, but half the booked price must be paid.

Attendance cancelled after one week before the event will incur full costs.

Cancellation emails should be sent to the Event Steward as early as possible.
