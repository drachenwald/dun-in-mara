Archery for all, and all for archery!  

Duck! is a one-day event of shooting and other archery-related stuff, to be held at Clara Scout Hall, Clara, Co. Offaly. It's easily accessible by public transport- the site is a short walk from the train station, with regular trains coming in from Dublin and Galway.

There will be both a field shoot and a target range available on the day. All activities will be aimed at the archery community. Although if you aren't an archer, there will be people gathered at the fire or on the range, working on Arts & Sciences projects to keep you company and cheer our brave archers on. 

Lunch and snacks will be served. As with all SCA events, make an effort to wear medieval clothing. Deadline for reservations (due to our insurance) is August 21st.
