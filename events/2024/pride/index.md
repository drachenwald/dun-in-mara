## Pride

**29 June 2024**

The SCA Shire of Dun In Mara will participate in Dublin's Pride Parade. Email Aodh at **aodhosiadhail@gmail.com** for more details! This page will be updated once we know where in the march we are, and where we'll meet up in advance. 

The March usually takes about 3 hours to complete. Wear shoes in which you can both stand for a while and walk. Otherwise, please wear your brightest coloured garb. If you need loaner garb, please let Aodh know!

Afterwards, we'll hang out for a while in the Pride Village at Merrion Square, and then move on to a gathering at the house of some of our members in Crumlin - contact some of us for details.

If you'd like to come along, but have mobility issues which would prevent you from marching, let us know and we'll sort out access - we're also happy to push a wheelchair if that helps!
