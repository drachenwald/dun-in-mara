This edition of the Hastiludes is exceptionally held outside of Britannia, the usual duration and accommodations proposed have been expanded to accommodate our foreign visitors! A large heated hall is available to us to fight, eat and sleep in, with large kitchen and showers.

The program is yet to be clearly defined, but only one activity is on the schedule: armoured combat. Training, pick-ups, talks and lessons. Fear missing out on other activities? Don't, none other are planned. The site is available to us from Friday evening to Sunday, with all main activities taking place on Saturday, with room on Sunday morning for those asking for more. We are expecting a few Scandinavian visitors, who sprouted the seed of this edition at Double Wars this year, this is an ideal occasion to meet them on the field!

*Who is it for?* Anyone interested in armoured combat regardless of experience, in or out of armour or anyone willing to help with the organisation.

*But how do I get there?* Fear not, once you reach the Island, a train line will get you a mere 5 minutes walk away from the site. We also have roomy cars that can accommodate you, your armour and take you there and back.

*But where do we stay?* The site has a large heated hall with an additional fireplace, sofas, mattresses and we will bring more furniture to accommodate everyone. All you will need is your sleeping bag... and earplugs.

*But what do we eat?* The hall being free from only 20h30 on Friday, a Traveler's Fare will be organised. From Saturday breakfast to Sunday lunch, should you choose to opt in, your meals will be prepared by our local event cooks! Please book a meal plan ticket for each person opting in.

*It would suit me if I could arrive a day before or leave a day after, do I have to pay for a hotel?* Very unlikely, some of us are more than happy to house our faraway visitors, subject to room availability and individual arrangements.
