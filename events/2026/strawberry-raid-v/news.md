**Our theme for the arts and sciences at Strawberry Raid V is ‘Be (un)Seen’.**  

<img src="drachenwald/dun-in-mara/images/SR-AS-announcement.png" height="248" width="407">

We’re going to be focusing on the exciting, flashy side of our arts and science practices. We are planning a red carpet style runway show where everyone can wear their fanciest garb, be photographed if you want, and answer questions about what you’re wearing. We are also planning a dedicated tent in the social area of the campground for arts and sciences; a place for everyone to sit and craft together, ask each other questions, share materials, and try out new techniques and tools. And as always, our teachers will be publicly sharing their research and expertise with the group. Let’s shout about our projects from the top of the tower!   

But, what about the other side of A&S? The side that is usually more quiet and potentially secretive? What are those historical undergarments that you’re wearing under your fabulous garb? Tell me about the solo hours of research you’ve done before you ever got a finished product that you could share with others. What does your craft space look like in your home?   
I’ve even heard rumours that there may be a darker side to the A&S this year; some code breaking, black markets, and more…   

If you’re interested in teaching a class at this year’s Strawberry Raid the link for teacher sign-ups is now live: https://forms.gle/EEVjPvAZ9Qv2akFLA ! If you have any questions at all, feel free to reach out to me and ask.

A message from Baron Etienne:

**A Dozen Blades for Raiding** (and plans for the Autumn too).  
For Strawberry Raid this year Viscount Cernac and myself have set an intention to see 6 fencers from Eplaheimr and 6 fencers from Dun in Mara attending.  
Given that we also usually see  several fencers from elsewhere attending this should give us upwards of 15 fencers all going well!  

So, let’s start planning!  
Do you need a lift?  
Do you ned help with armour or weapons? 
Do you need help sorting accommodation for the event?  
Want help authorising to fence?  
Just let us know and we’ll be delighted to help coordinate support for you!  
Strawberry Raid takes place in Southern Dun in Mara (Near Rosslare in Wexford) and runs from Wednesday 27th May to Monday 1st June.
That gives us 5 days of fun at a period castle.  
Strawberry Raid is the largest annual event on the island and has a lot to offer, from armoured combat, fencing, archery and craft classes to the social side.  
More info here: [https://duninmara.org/events/2026/strawberry-raid-v/](https://duninmara.org/events/2026/strawberry-raid-v/). 

Then later in the year we are also looking to encourage a large tournament at Medieval Dead (right in the middle of the country in Clara, Co Offaly) around Halloween.  

We’re also looking at a dedicated fencing training event in January 2027 so our fencing community can build their year around certainty of regular fencing activity on the island.  

You also have Champions of Lough Devnaree every September to look forward to having a tourney at.  

For lots of fencing this year – Abu!  
Your friendly local Master’s of Defence,  
Baron Etienne OP, OL, OD.  
Viscount Cernac OP, OL, OD.
