A message from Baron Etienne:

**A Dozen Blades for Raiding** (and plans for the Autumn too).  
For Strawberry Raid this year Viscount Cernac and myself have set an intention to see 6 fencers from Eplaheimr and 6 fencers from Dun in Mara attending.  
Given that we also usually see  several fencers from elsewhere attending this should give us upwards of 15 fencers all going well!  

So, let’s start planning!  
Do you need a lift?  
Do you ned help with armour or weapons? 
Do you need help sorting accommodation for the event?  
Want help authorising to fence?  
Just let us know and we’ll be delighted to help coordinate support for you!  
Strawberry Raid takes place in Southern Dun in Mara (Near Rosslare in Wexford) and runs from Wednesday 27th May to Monday 1st June.
That gives us 5 days of fun at a period castle.  
Strawberry Raid is the largest annual event on the island and has a lot to offer, from armoured combat, fencing, archery and craft classes to the social side.  
More info here: [https://duninmara.org/events/2026/strawberry-raid-v/](https://duninmara.org/events/2026/strawberry-raid-v/). 

Then later in the year we are also looking to encourage a large tournament at Medieval Dead (right in the middle of the country in Clara, Co Offaly) around Halloween.  

We’re also looking at a dedicated fencing training event in January 2027 so our fencing community can build their year around certainty of regular fencing activity on the island.  

You also have Champions of Lough Devnaree every September to look forward to having a tourney at.  

For lots of fencing this year – Abu!  
Your friendly local Master’s of Defence,  
Baron Etienne OP, OL, OD.  
Viscount Cernac OP, OL, OD.
