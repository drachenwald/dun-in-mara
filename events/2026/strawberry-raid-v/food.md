## Food & Other Supplies


**Centra grocery store at the Killinick Top Oil petrol/gas station** (c. 7 mins drive away) has a hot counter (chicken, sausages, fries, hot breakfast items etc) and a sandwich counter, as well as a coffee machine, if you wish to buy inexpensive ready made food. Here you can also buy basic grocery supplies as well as fuel for your car. There is also a laundromat outside the store, in case you need to wash and dry clothes/sheets/etc during or immediately after the event. Additionally, there are waste disposal and recycling banks.

**[Meyler’s Millhouse Bar & Restaurant](https://meylersmillhouse.com/)** is the closest pub/restaurant about 2 mins drive away, which serves the usual alcoholic drinks as well as delicious sit-down/takeout food. The event team will try to have some menus available on site.         

**[Karoo Farmshop & Cafe](http://karoo.ie/)** in Killinick is a specialty food store. They serve breakfast and lunch, and we have heard that they are good, but we haven’t managed to find a free table there yet! 

Further pubs, takeaways and cafes are available in Wexford town and Rosslare. 

Wexford town has all the usual supermarkets (SuperValu, Tesco, ALDI, Lidl), pharmacies, as well as a convenient hardware store (Woodie’s in Wexford Retail Park). In Ireland, alcohol can be purchased in grocery stores, at petrol/gas stations and in “off-licences” (liquor stores) during specific hours (Monday to Saturday from 10:30am to 10:00pm; Sundays from 12:30pm to 10:00 pm). You need to be over 18 to buy and be served alcohol legally.
