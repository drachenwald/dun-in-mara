## Imbolc

**1 February, 2026**

February hangs heavy in many a heart  
The sun still hides behind rain swollen clouds   
and yet it fights each day to shine a bit longer   
over the winter-worn multitudes   

Let us fight that winter melancholy together  
Join us in celebrating the coming of light   
at our one-day revel, Imbolc   
As in past times people celebrated  
the Chailleach of winter giving sway to Brigid,   
so shall we, with the making of candles, butter, and planting seeds.    


For the feast, we put a call to all who would join us, and hope ye answer.  
We would love to highlight the foods that remained in February, those that were stored and preserved in all manners whether it be drying, curing, salting or other methods of preservation. We can share what we have preserved from now until the event, eat together and share our experiences.   
We will update the calendar when further details are secured, but we want to light the spark of creativity and give time for the preserving of food stuffs.   
Any questions can be directed to the event stewards, Gwerful an Filí and Mallymkun Rauði.
