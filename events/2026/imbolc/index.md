## Imbolc

**1 February, 2026**

February hangs heavy in many a heart  
The sun still hides behind rain swollen clouds   
and yet it fights each day to shine a bit longer   
over the winter-worn multitudes   

Let us fight that winter melancholy together  
Join us in celebrating the coming of light   
at our one-day revel, Imbolc   
As in past times people celebrated  
the Chailleach of winter giving sway to Brigid,   
so shall we, with the making of candles, butter, and planting seeds.    

**Food**
For the feast, we put a call to all who would join us, and hope ye answer.  
We would love to highlight the foods that remained in February, those that were stored and preserved in all manners whether it be drying, curing, salting or other methods of preservation. We can share what we have preserved from now until the event, eat together and share our experiences.

Our main meal will be a **potluck** and will feature foods that have been preserved, or would have remained at this liminal time between the depth of winter and the resurgence of Spring.
If you don’t preserve anything, we would love for you to join us as well! Here are some ideas to how you can contribute to the feast.
• Cold meats and cheeses are excellent.  
• Fruits (fresh or dried) and pickles of any kind (from fish to gherkins).  
• German-style sausages are ideal.  
• Boiled eggs and pies are good.  
• Baklava isn’t quite period, but there are very similar period desserts so we welcome it!  
• Halwa, barfi, and almost all Middle Eastern sweet things are great!  

**Activities**
During the day there will be the following activities:  
- Candle Making  
- Butter Making  
- A&S Display  
- Bardic  

Any questions can be directed to the event stewards, Gwerful an Filí and Mallymkun Rauði.  

### A&S Display
The theme for Imbolc's A&S Display is "Light". So bring along your (_brightest or lightest_) A&S project and let us all enjoy the spark of your creativity. All entries that relate to or invoke the theme are welcome, and artisans are encouraged to be creative in their interpretation. Entries do not need to be created specifically for the display; artisans are welcome to enter something they have previously made. Entries do not need to be physical items; research entries are very welcome.

Documentation of your entry is encouraged but not strictly required. We encourage you to include a short document in your entry with
your SCA name
a short description of the item
its connection to the theme and your inspiration
what period and location it is attributed to
any other information you would like to include (optional), e.g., how was it made in period, and who would have used it? What tools, materials and practices were used (and did you do anything differently in your entry?) You could also include sources you used for your research, describe your process for creating your entry, or talk about what you learned from creating it.
All attendees are cordially invited to view the display, discuss their entries with participants and ask questions.

If you wish to participate in the display, please contact Ingemar of Dun in Mara on Discord, email (nadja@ef.gy) or at the event so we can allocate a table to you.
