## Pride

**24 June 2023**

The SCA Shire of Dun In Mara will participate in Dublin's Pride Parade.

Participation has been confirmed; Aodh has wristbands for access. Contact him via Discord or email to <a href="mailto:aodhosiadhail@gmail.com">aodhosiadhail@gmail.com</a> to arrange to get hold of one in advance, should you need to. Otherwise, we'll meet up before the actual March (which starts at 12:00) outside the Grand Social on Liffey Street from 10:00 onwards (or inside, if the weather requires it). We'll move on to O'Connell Street at around 11:00; we're in either Block 4 or Block 5, which puts us slightly north of the Spire on the west side of O'Connell Street.

The March usually takes about 3 hours to complete. Wear shoes in which you can both stand for a while and walk. Otherwise, please wear your brightest coloured garb. If you need loaner garb, please let Aodh know!

Afterwards, we'll hang out for a while in the Pride Village at Merrion Square. At 18:00, we'll move on to the Storyteller pub on Grand Canal Street, where we've a table booked. There will be some food there; monetary contributions toward it are appreciated but not required.

If you'd like to come along, but have mobility issues which would prevent you from marching, you can collect a wristband at the Grand Social and meet us at the Pride Vollage afterward, or at the Storyteller - whatever suits!
