## Pride

**24 June 2023**

The SCA Shire of Dun In Mara will participate in Dublin's Pride Parade. Keep an eye here for further details!

As of mid-April, we've submitted our details to the Pride organisation, but haven't had a response yet - we expect one in early June, and our participation will be fully confirmed then!

In the meantime, you can read more about [Dublin's Pride Parade](https://dublinpride.ie/march-and-parade/), or just about [Dublin Pride](https://dublinpride.ie/) in general - there are other events on throughout June.
