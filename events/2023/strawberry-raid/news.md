## News

### January 28, 2023

At Strawberry Raid (1-5 June, Ireland) we now have crash space (shared accommodation) available. 

If you do not have or are unable to bring your own tent, and getting off-site accommodation is not an option for you, we are pleased to be able to offer shared tent accommodation for a limited number of guests.  These shared spaces will be prioritised for guests visiting from abroad.

This is a great opportunity if you would like to attend but aren't able to transport your own accommodation or spend the money for a B&B.

The booking form has been modified to include a question about a space in the crash tent. If you have already booked but would like to request a crash space, please email the registration steward <a href="mailto:aoifeniaodhagain@gmail.com">aoifeniaodhagain@gmail.com</a>.

As always, information about the event and the registration form are available at: <a href="https://duninmara.org/events/2023/strawberry-raid/">https://duninmara.org/events/2023/strawberry-raid/</a>
