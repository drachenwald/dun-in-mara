The SCA Shire of Dun In Mara welcomes you back to Strawberry Raid, five days of medieval camping around the beautifully restored 15th-16th century tower house of [Sigginstown Castle](https://www.sigginstowncastle.com/), in the beautiful sunny South-East of Ireland.

We will enjoy a range of medieval activities from the arts, crafts and camp cookery to the martial pursuits of armoured combat, fencing and archery. Beginners and experienced practitioners are welcome across the board.

## Accessibility

The ground of the site is level but uneven, including gravel and fields. The restored period tower house has narrow steep spiral stairs and small rooms. The stairs have handrails installed. Any activities inside the tower are likely to take place in the first two floors. 

The barn is within a short reach of the camping area across an uneven ground. The barn itself has a gravel floor. 

Portaloos/portapotties are the only available toilets on the site. Tents for anyone with mobility issues can be placed closer to the toilets, paths and access ways. Please contact the camping coordinator Aodh Ó Siadhail at [aodhosiadhail@gmail.com](mailto:aodhosiadhail@gmail.com) to let him know in advance.

During dark hours, we will have small lights marking the entrances to the encampment as well as near the toilets. Please feel free to bring flashlights if you need them to move around in the dark.

Noise in the camp is requested to be minimal during certain hours (est. 11 pm - 8 am).

<a name="travel"></a>
## Travel

The event is easily reachable from Dublin Airport via the M11, 20 minutes drive from Wexford railway station, and 15 minutes drive from Rosslare ferryport with connections to the UK and continental Europe. We may be able to provide pick-ups from Wexford and Rosslare on a case by case basis, please discuss your needs with the Reservations Steward. 

Driving from Dublin Airport is straightforward via the M1, M50, M11/N11 and N25. It takes about two hours. The main roads are well kept and well signposted and foreign drivers generally don’t find driving on the main roads difficult, despite driving on the left. Some motorways have tolls. If you’re hiring a car, ask your rental agency what the protocol is concerning road tolls.    

Coordinates: 52.20591, -6.444499 (main event gate)

If you’re driving from Rosslare ferryport, just follow Google or another map provider. Your drive will take about 15-20 minutes. 

**Public transport** from Dublin is available via bus and train. 

   **Bus**: [Bus Eireann](https://www.buseireann.ie/) route 2-X2 Dublin Airport - Wexford Town. From Wexford town, you should take a taxi or arrange a lift.

   **Train**: [Irish Rail](https://www.irishrail.ie/en-ie/) route [Dublin Connolly Station - Rosslare Europort](https://www.irishrail.ie/IrishRail/media/Timetable-PDF-s/Connolly-DART-timetables/08_dublin-rosslare.pdf). We recommend that you get off in Wexford town to maximise the availability of taxis, if you need one.  

   A taxi from Wexford town should take about 20 minutes to the site. 

If you need a pick-up from Wexford town or from Rosslare, in the first instance please talk to your friends about arranging a car pool. If this is not possible, please talk to the Reservations Steward about a pick-up. Please note that these are strictly subject to available vehicles and available drivers. We need to know about any pick-ups required at least one week before the event. A pick-up may incur a small charge due to the high cost of fuel. 

## The Site

Sigginstown Castle is owned by SCA members who very generously open their home for us. Please respect their generosity, their home and their neighbours at all times. Any requests from the site owners must be complied with immediately. Smoking is forbidden indoors including inside the barn.

<a name="weather"></a>
## Weather

Ireland is an Atlantic island, so we get a lot of rain, but in shorter bursts than our friends in continental climates. It is pretty typical to have a sunny morning and a rainy afternoon, and other way round. Wind, in various quantities, is pretty much omnipresent, more so on the coasts. Sigginstown is very close to the sea, and the camping field does not have much in the way of sheltering trees or buildings, so you will want to make sure that your tent is well secured. Very flimsy modern gazebos are unlikely to survive throughout the event, although a bigger, sturdier one sheltered a large camp kitchen successfully in the first year.  

On rainy days, as long as your tent does not spring a leak, you should remain nice and dry inside, as the ground is able to accommodate a lot of rain. We have the  barn and the tower house to gather in during bad weather. 

It is impossible to predict what the weather is going to be like until a couple of days prior to the event, and even then the outlook may change quickly. We estimate that we will have some sunshine, and some rain, with day temperatures anything between 15°C/59°F and 23°C/73.4°F. It’s a good idea to bring layered garb with a rain-resistant overgarment. If you have the baggage space, a woollen overgarment and a hat, at least for evenings, nights and early mornings, is a good idea.
