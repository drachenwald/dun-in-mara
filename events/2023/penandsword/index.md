## Pen & Sword

**15-17 September 2023**

As summer gives way to Autumn and the Harvest is complete the Shire of Dun in Mara is pleased to invite all of those with a love for the flashing blade or the flourished quill to join us at Siggninstown Castle for a weekend of classes and camaraderie.
We will have fencing classes and sparring happening throughout the day on Saturday, some dancing to add some extra pep to fencers' steps and all weekend scribes can come together and share with other scribes, new and experienced alike. Sigginstown Castle has a special atmosphere and the evening is a particular joy for those who love the Bardic Arts.

## Accessibility

The ground of the site is level but uneven, including gravel and fields. The restored period tower house has narrow steep spiral stairs and small rooms. The stairs have handrails installed. Any activities inside the tower are likely to take place in the first two floors. 

The barn is within a short reach of the camping area across an uneven ground. The barn itself has a gravel floor. 

Portaloos/portapotties are the only available toilets on the site. Tents for anyone with mobility issues can be placed closer to the toilets, paths and access ways. Please contact <a href="mailto:anneleyn.cornelisse@gmail.com">Anneleyn Cornelisse</a>, <a href="mailto:p.macfad@gmail.com">Duncan Chaucer</a>, or <a href="orlaithcaomhanach@gmail.com">Órlaith Chaomhánach</a> to let them know in advance.

During dark hours, we will have small lights marking the entrances to the encampment as well as near the toilets. Please feel free to bring flashlights if you need them to move around in the dark.

Noise in the camp is requested to be minimal during certain hours (est. 11 pm - 8 am).

## Travel

The event is easily reachable from Dublin Airport via the M11, 20 minutes drive from Wexford railway station, and 15 minutes drive from Rosslare ferryport with connections to the UK and continental Europe. We may be able to provide pick-ups from Wexford and Rosslare on a case by case basis, please discuss your needs with the Reservations Steward. 

Driving from Dublin Airport is straightforward via the M1, M50, M11/N11 and N25. It takes about two hours. The main roads are well kept and well signposted and foreign drivers generally don’t find driving on the main roads difficult, despite driving on the left. Some motorways have tolls. If you’re hiring a car, ask your rental agency what the protocol is concerning road tolls.
