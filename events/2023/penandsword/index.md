## Pen & Sword

**15-17 September 2023**

As summer gives way to Autumn and the Harvest is complete the Shire of Dun in Mara is pleased to invite all of those with a love for the flashing blade or the flourished quill to join us at Siggninstown Castle for a weekend of classes and camaraderie.
We will have fencing classes and sparring happening throughout the day on Saturday, some dancing to add some extra pep to fencers' steps and all weekend scribes can come together and share with other scribes, new and experienced alike. Sigginstown Castle has a special atmosphere and the evening is a particular joy for those who love the Bardic Arts.

Booking will open soon!
