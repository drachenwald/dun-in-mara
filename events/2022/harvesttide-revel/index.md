## Harvesttide Revel

**23 October 2022**

Dun in Mara invites you to Drimnagh Castle, a moated 13th century Norman castle, on Sunday 23rd of October for a very special one-day event. We will have this wonderful castle to ourselves for the whole day, 10am to 4pm, for fighting in the courtyard, singing and dancing in the hall, games and crafts wherever the mood takes you and a meal together.

[BOOKING IS ESSENTIAL](https://fienta.com/harvesttide-revel)

We regret that the site is not wheelchair friendly due to a gravelled courtyard and tight/steep stairs.

## Planned Activities
You can watch or try out fencing, armoured combat and throwing knives as well as different medieval crafts and skills, for example calligraphy or dancing. Details to be announced closer to the time. If you have friends or relatives who are curious about what we do, but don’t want to commit to a full event, this is an ideal time for them to come along and have a look! We will be wearing garb (medieval clothing), but don’t worry if you haven’t got anything that looks medieval. We can lend you something for the day if you let us know in the booking form.
