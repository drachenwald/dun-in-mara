## Harvesttide Revel

**23 October 2022**

Dun in Mara invites you to Drimnagh Castle, a moated 13th century Norman castle, on Sunday 23rd of October for a very special one-day event. We will have this wonderful castle to ourselves for the whole day, 10am to 4pm, for fighting in the courtyard, singing and dancing in the hall, games and crafts wherever the mood takes you and a meal together.

[BOOKING IS ESSENTIAL](https://fienta.com/harvesttide-revel)

We regret that the site is not wheelchair friendly due to a gravelled courtyard and tight/steep stairs.

## Planned Activities
You can watch or try out fencing, armoured combat and throwing knives as well as different medieval crafts and skills, for example calligraphy or dancing. Details to be announced closer to the time. If you have friends or relatives who are curious about what we do, but don’t want to commit to a full event, this is an ideal time for them to come along and have a look! We will be wearing garb (medieval clothing), but don’t worry if you haven’t got anything that looks medieval. We can lend you something for the day if you let us know in the booking form.

## Costs & Food
The cost for the event is €25 per head for the day / 20€ concession (students, pensioners, unwaged). Children under 14 are free when accompanied by an adult).

### Food
Concerning food, we will have a meal together which will consist of a potluck (where everybody brings something). Don't stress about it, just bring enough to feed yourself and a bit extra.
However, if you want to do just period food (namely European medieval): First, don't do potatoes, tomatoes, sweetcorn, pumpkins or chillis - they're New World stuff. For easy things, think of picnic food. Bread is always good - loaves, not sliced pan. Breadrolls are great. Cold meats, almost anything except turkey. Pretty much all fruits are good. Cheese of any kind is excellent. Boiled eggs, pork pies, indeed pies of almost any kind. Most German-style sausages are good (Spanish ones tend to have tomato and/or chilli in). Pickles of all kinds, from fish through mushrooms. Nuts, dates, dried fruit. Baklava isn't quite period, but there are very similar things, so it's good. Halwa, barfi, and almost all Middle Eastern sweet things are also good!
