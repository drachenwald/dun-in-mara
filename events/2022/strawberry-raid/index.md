## Welcome

Dun In Mara warmly welcomes you to the first Strawberry Raid, a five day long camping event in the beautiful historical south-east of Ireland, in and on the grounds of [Sigginstown Castle](https://www.sigginstowncastle.com/). The event is easily reachable from Dublin and 15 minutes drive from Rosslare ferryport with connections to the UK and continental Europe.  

We will enjoy a range of medieval activities from the arts, crafts and camp cookery to the martial pursuits of armoured combat, fencing and archery. Beginners and experienced practitioners are welcome across the board. 

If you wish to stay at the site, you may camp in period or mundane tents as you wish and we will not be separating these into period and mundane campgrounds, so you can form an encampment with your friends regardless of your tent style. Apart from tents, we do ask that any mundane equipment is used discreetly and is kept out of sight should we have visitors from the public. We will have a better idea of the facilities available later in the spring, but please plan to cook your own food in your encampment. Drinking water and portaloos will be available. 

If you wish to sleep off-site, Rosslare and the areas nearby have many B&Bs and guest houses for your comfort. Hotels can be found in Wexford town. 

If you only wish to drop by for a day, you are welcome to do so at the cost of a day visit. 

Strawberry Raid will be a new event type in Lough Devnaree (island of Ireland) on a developing site. We ask for your patience as we navigate the inevitable bumps that will occur in the lead up to and during the event. Sigginstown Castle is owned by Mistress Damiana (Liz Jones) and Lord Gruffyd (Gordon Jones) who have been playing in the SCA for over 30 years. Their neighbours live close by around the site and we request that you will treat them with that courtesy and consideration that SCA members are famed for. 


## Register

Registration will open on 1 February 2022.

## Travel

If you are flying into Dublin, you may wish to consider a rental car. The drive from Dublin airport to the site takes approximately two hours on good condition motorways. Please remember in Ireland we drive on the left! 

If you prefer public transport, you can take the train from Connolly Station for Rosslare Europort. A taxi ride from Rosslare Europort to the site will take approximately 15-20 minutes. You can also get off at Wexford Railway Station, in which case a taxi or other car ride will take about 30 minutes.

## Accessibility

The ground of the site is level but uneven, including gravel and fields. We expect very few activities to take place inside the castle itself, but for those that do, the building is a restored period tower house with narrow steep stairs and small rooms. The stairs have handrails installed. Any activities inside the tower are likely to take place in the first two floors.  


## COVID-19

We and the site will follow the Irish government’s health advice at the time of the event. If this means that the event can’t go ahead, then we will cancel the event (with as much notice as we can give) and arrange refunds. 

As attendance requirements in terms of vaccinations and testing change often, please keep checking back here for up to date requirements. These will be in line with those issued by the Irish Governments regarding organised outdoor events. 

If you have Covid-19 symptoms within ten days prior to your planned arrival at the event, we strongly encourage you to get tested. Should you test positive, you will not be permitted to attend the event but you will be issued a refund. 

If you begin to feel unwell while attending the event, we ask you to inform the event steward. If your symptoms match those associated with Covid-19, we ask you and those camping with you to self-isolate and to leave the event as soon as possible. 

## Code of Conduct

The SCA prohibits bullying and harassment of all individuals and groups. Event participants will be expected to be polite toward other SCA participants as well as toward any members of the public who may attend; to respect other people and respect their needs: to take all reasonable steps to make everyone feel welcome and safe within our society, regardless of gender identity, age, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, ability or body type. Any event participant who feels they are not safe at the event is requested to immediately contact the event staff.
