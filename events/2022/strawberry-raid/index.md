## Welcome

Dun In Mara warmly welcomes you to the first Strawberry Raid, a five day long camping event in the beautiful historical south-east of Ireland, in and on the grounds of Sigginstown Castle. The event is easily reachable from Dublin and 15 minutes drive from Rosslare ferryport with connections to the UK and continental Europe.  

We will enjoy a range of medieval activities from the arts, crafts and camp cookery to the martial pursuits of armoured combat, fencing and archery. Beginners and experienced practitioners are welcome across the board. 

If you wish to stay at the site, you may camp in period or mundane tents as you wish and we will not be separating these into period and mundane campgrounds, so you can form an encampment with your friends regardless of your tent style. Apart from tents, we do ask that any mundane equipment is used discreetly and is kept out of sight should we have visitors from the public. 

If you wish to sleep off-site, Rosslare and the areas nearby have many B&Bs and guest houses for your comfort. Hotels can be found in Wexford town. 

If you only wish to drop by for a day, you are welcome to do so at the cost of a day visit. 

## Register

Registration will open in due course.

## Travel

Sigginstown Castle is easily findable on Google Maps.

If you are flying into Dublin, you may wish to consider a rental car. The drive from Dublin airport to the site takes approximately two hours on good condition motorways. Please remember in Ireland we drive on the left! 

If you prefer public transport, you can take the train from Connolly Station for Rosslare Europort. A taxi ride from Rosslare Europort to the site will take approximately 15-20 minutes. You can also get off at Wexford Railway Station, in which case a taxi or other car ride will take about 30 minutes.

## COVID-19

We and the site will follow the Irish government’s health advice at the time of the event. If this means that the event can’t go ahead, then we will cancel the event (with as much notice as we can give) and arrange refunds. 

As attendance requirements in terms of vaccinations and testing change often, please keep checking back here for up to date requirements. These will be in line with those issued by the Irish Governments regarding organised outdoor events. 

If you have Covid-19 symptoms within ten days prior to your planned arrival at the event, we strongly encourage you to get tested. Should you test positive, you will not be permitted to attend the event but you will be issued a refund. 

If you begin to feel unwell while attending the event, we ask you to inform the event steward. If your symptoms match those associated with Covid-19, we ask you and those camping with you to self-isolate and to leave the event as soon as possible.
