Martial activities at Strawberry Raid will include armoured fighting, fencing and archery. 

## Armoured Combat
Armoured Combat Marshal in Charge: TBA

Covid willing, we will finally be able to enjoy Duke Sean Tarragon's Fighting Clinic that has been postponed twice previously due to the pandemic. Duke Sean hails from the Kingdom of Artemisia, having reigned as its King seven times. He is known for being the youngest person in the SCA to be knighted, and at Strawberry Raid he will mark 35 years of his knighthood. He has raised seven Knights, out of whom three have achieved Duchies of their own. He is one of the driving forces behind the weekly Coaches Corner online show, which discusses the practices and philosophies of teaching SCA fighting.

The Fighting Clinic workshop will take place on Saturday and Sunday and it is suitable for all levels. Due to the cost involved in bringing our visiting teacher over, those wishing to take part in the two-day workshop are asked to pay a small extra fee. 

Details on other armoured fighting activities will be added in due course.
