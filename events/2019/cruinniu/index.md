**5-7 April, 2018.**  
Aspire Centre, Clara, Co Offaly, Ireland.

Fighters and dancers ahoy! Following last year’s successful introduction of the new fighting event in the Kingdom’s Calendar, Dun In Mara once more invites you to a weekend of the arts of war and the arts of peace, supported by the shire’s usual hearty hospitality. We warmly welcome all from outside our island who would wish to come cross swords with us, to dance with us, or to just make merry with us.

## Our visiting teachers
This year, we are particularly proud and pleased to welcome Sir Donngal de Buchanan and Mistress Iona Putnika, who are travelling from all the way from the Kingdom of Atenveldt (Arizona, USA) to teach at this event.

### Master Sir Donngal de Buchanan 
Sir Donngal joined the SCA in 1998 and began fighting in 2000. He was elevated to Knight in 2005 and Laurel in 2007. He was inducted into the Knights of St. Michael in 2006.  

Sir Donngal works professionally as an armourer and owner of Aesir Metalwyrks, a skill he learned in the SCA. His pastimes include working, going to the beach, having a Mai Tai and sunset walks with Angie.

### Mistress Iona Putnika
Her Excellency, Mistress Iona Putnika, a 20 year veteran Middle Eastern dance instructor, joins us all the way from the Kingdom of Atenveldt. She will be sharing her experience with you in the form of basic dance moves, and zills if desired.
