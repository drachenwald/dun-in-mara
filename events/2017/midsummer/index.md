Drimnagh Castle, a moated 13th century Norman castle, will welcome Dun In Mara and our friends on the 8th of July for a very special one-day event.

We will have this wonderful castle to ourselves for the whole day, 10am to 10pm, so even after a full day of activities, evening revelry is definitely on the cards. Speaking of cards, bring your games to while away the hours.

**BOOKING IS ESSENTIAL.** Please see below for booking information.

We regret that the site is not wheelchair friendly due to a gravelled courtyard and tight/steep stairs.

## Planned Activities

We will be enjoying fencing, an armoured combat tourney, rounds of thrown weapons as well as Arts & Sciences. Details to be announced closer to the time. 

We are also planning an experiment in bread baking in a traditional bread oven.
 
If you have friends or relatives who are curious about what we do, but don’t want to commit to a full event, this is an ideal time for them to come along and have a look! 
Garb (medieval clothing) is required, but don’t worry if you haven’t got anything that looks medieval – just let us know during your booking! We can lend you something for the day if need be.

## Costs & Food

Food will consist of a pot-luck lunch and dinner. Lord Aodh has also graciously offered to barbecue whatever meat we bring him. Please indicate in the booking form what you will be bringing.
