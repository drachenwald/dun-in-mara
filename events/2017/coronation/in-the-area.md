This area of Ireland is rich with history. While the event runs from Friday to Sunday, we think that this will be an excellent opportunity to extend your stay in Ireland and visit some of the other historical and medieval attractions that are close by.

### Newgrange, Knowth and Dowth (Visitors’ centre 1 minute walk from the event site)
A world heritage UNESCO site that was constructed over 5000 years ago by Ireland’s first settlers, these Megalithic passage tombs predate the Pyramids of Egypt and Stonehenge in England.

### Monasterboice (15 minutes by car from the site)
One of Ireland’s earliest Christian settlements from the 5th Century, famous for its fine examples of Celtic High Crosses from the 10th Century.

### The Hill of Tara (35 minutes by car from the site)
The Hill of Tara was once the ancient seat of power in Ireland.

### Trim Castle (30 minutes by car from the site)
Built by Hugh De Lacy in 1173, this is Ireland’s largest and best example of an Anglo-Norman Castle.
