For Drachenwald Summer Coronation 2017, we are coming to Newgrange.

The location for the event is <a href="http://www.newgrangelodge.com/">Newgrange Lodge</a>. This is located just a moment&#8217;s walk from the <a href="http://www.heritageireland.ie/en/midlands-eastcoast/brunaboinnevisitorcentre/">Brú na Bóinne visitors centre</a>, which is the gateway to Newgrange. Newgrange is a passage tomb that was built during the Neolithic period around 3200 BC, and is older than Stonehenge and the Egyptian pyramids.

This map shows Newgrange Lodge on the left, and Drogheda Bus and Rail stations on the right.
