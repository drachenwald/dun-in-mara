Duck Too! is a daylong event serving the archery community in Lough Devnaree - but open to all in the Kingdom! Doors will open at 8:30am to facilitate early arrivals from the train station - please check the train schedule well in time to make your travel plans. We will have snacks available and will be serving a hearty lunch.

**Pre-booking is essential.** 

The site is moderately accessible, with some bumpy doorways. 

### Planned Activities

Archery! We will have a field shoot along the river in the grounds of Clara House, next door - bring appropriate footwear for possibly damp woodland conditions. We'll also have target shooting at the venue itself.

Specific details and a schedule of activities will be announced closer to the event.  

If you, or your friends or family, are interested in archery in the SCA, this one-day event is an ideal time to come along and have a look! We will be wearing medieval clothing (garb), but don’t worry if you don’t have anything that looks historical. We are happy to lend you clothing for the day if you let us know on the booking form. 

There's also a good spot to hang out by the fire and engage in Arts & Sciences if you're not into shooting, or just accompanying an archer. Tea, coffee, and the odd snack will be available through the day.

### Costs

€20 — SCA Member  
€15 — Unwaged SCA Member   
€25 — SCA Non-member
Free - Children 12 and under

(You can get [https://membermojo.co.uk/scauk](SCA Membership) easily - it costs £UK15 for a year's membership, so you'll recoup the cost quickly with a few practices or events!)

### Food

We'll be providing a hearty lunch, courtesy of a kitchen run by Máistir Aodh Ó Sidahil. Let us know any allergies or food sensitivies when you book.
