Look, we'll level with you. 2020 has taken a bite out of us. We've had to cancel or postpone event after event. Perhaps worse than not being able to do anything is not being able to _plan_ anything.

So here's the deal. We have a date. We have a beautiful site. We have ten gorgeous tents already set up for us. We have a barbecue on which we can cook our own food.

If we can feasibly and safely run an event on this weekend, we're going to do so.

Dun in Mara presents: an event, probably.

## Where?
If you're coming by public transport, the closest train station is Newbridge; you will need to arrange a taxi or a lift from the station. (Please note that we are not organising pickups at this event.)

The site opens at 18:00 on Friday 2nd October and closes at 11:00 on Sunday 4th October. Alcohol is allowed on site (though please keep modern vessels covered.)

## What's the schedule?

Who needs a schedule? We'll have marshals, we'll have space, let's do some things. Most importantly, let's see each other again. It's been a long time.

## What about food and facilities?

We encourage you to <b>bring your own food to cook.</b> There is <b>an outdoor barbecue</b> which will be available all day. A fridge is also available for use.

There is a shower block on site. Please bring your own towels.

## But what about COVID-19?

Both we and the site will of course follow the government's health advice at the time of the event. If this means that the event can't go ahead, then we will cancel the event (with as much notice as we can give) and arrange refunds. Obviously we've already done exactly this for Harvest Tavern.

We have chosen the nature of this event – outdoors, with comfortable accommodation, and cooking for ourselves – to minimise the risks. We obviously can't make any guarantees, and recognise that some of us may be unable to attend regardless. But we think we can provide an environment that allows for comfortable, socially distanced interaction.

There are some other restrictions. **We will be unable to provide pickups, loaner garb or loaner feast gear** at this event. You are of course welcome to make your own arrangements with other attendees privately.

We'll use the same COVID-19 procedure as our fencing practices: soon before the event, we'll send you a survey, and we ask you to fill it in on the day of the event. If so indiciated by that survey, we would ask you not to attend this time.

## How do I register?

The registration cost is **€120 per tent.** Each tent has either a king bed or two double beds, with linens provided. You can fit up to four people in a tent, provided the additional people bring their own bed and bedding. 

Please **register everyone in your tent in the one form.** Because of COVID-19, we need to be strict about making sure everyone is registered in advance.

If you'd like to bring your own tent, drop us a message – we might be able to accommodate this, but we need to fill the on-site tents first.

Booking has closed.

After you register, we'll send you an email about payment by bank transfer.

## Accessibility

The event takes place outdoors on one level, but there are gravel paths throughout the ground. There are some steps to access the bathrooms and showers.
