# Travel to Clara #

This venue is located in the midlands of Ireland, about 90 minutes (by car or train) from Dublin. [Location on Google Maps.](https://goo.gl/maps/xqqim4mk9Gy)

### By rail from Dublin ###

The venue is very easily reached by train. Take the train from Dublin Heuston to Clara, and then take the 10 minute walk to the venue. [Train times and tickets from Irish Rail](http://www.irishrail.ie/); [walking directions from Google Maps](https://goo.gl/maps/woACqz2h3KC2).

### By air - Dublin Airport ###

There are two ways to get to Clara from Dublin Airport.

The first is to take the [Dublin Bus Airlink route 747](https://airlinkexpress.ie/) from outside the arrivals area (both terminal 1 and 2) to Heuston Station, then proceed as per "by rail from Dublin" above. (Do not take the route 757 or other buses, as they do not stop at Heuston.)

The second is to take the [Bus Éireann Route 20](http://buseireann.ie/timetables/X20-1531843275.pdf) to Kilbeggan, and catch a taxi or request a pick up from this location. **Do not take the X20** as this does not stop at Kilbeggan.

### By car ferry: Dublin Port or Rosslare ###

If you are travelling by car from north Wales or the north of England, we recommend <a href="http://www.irishferries.com/ie-en/to-ireland-from-britain/">Irish Ferries</a> or <a href="http://www.stenaline.co.uk/ferries-to-ireland">Stena Line</a> between Holyhead and Dublin Port. Irish Ferries has a fast ferry (the Swift) which does the crossing in two hours; the cruise ferry (the Ulysses) takes three and a quarter hours, but is a smoother ride and more reliable in poorer weather.

Once you reach Dublin Port, you can drive straight off the ferry and to Clara in about 75 minutes. This route takes you via the Dublin Port Tunnel, the M50 and the M4, all of which have tolls (and note that the [Port Tunnel tolls](https://www.dublintunnel.ie/toll-information) are quite high at peak times.) [Route via Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Dublin+Port,+North+Dock,+Dublin/Aspire+(Advanced+Sports+Performance+Ireland),+Clara+House+Estate,+Clara+Bridge,+Clara,+County+Offaly/@53.2873673,-7.4695699,9z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x48670f0526eb839f:0x58785dd13e88d2f!2m2!1d-6.2021736!2d53.3494386!1m5!1m1!1s0x485db192dbdba493:0x35fc92fdce968f93!2m2!1d-7.6161821!2d53.3433061!3e0).

If you&#8217;re driving from southern Wales or the south of England, you may prefer to take a ferry to Rosslare from Pembroke (Irish Ferries) or Fishguard (Stena). The drive from Rosslare to Clara takes about two and a half hours; if you take the most direct route using the N80 and M7, you also avoid tolls. <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Rosslare+Europort,+County+Wexford/Aspire+(Advanced+Sports+Performance+Ireland),+Clara+House+Estate,+Clara+Bridge,+Clara,+County+Offaly/@52.8446889,-7.412424,9z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x486817687c1c8bc5:0x5065140e0a6ebfd2!2m2!1d-6.3375525!2d52.2512209!1m5!1m1!1s0x485db192dbdba493:0x35fc92fdce968f93!2m2!1d-7.6161821!2d53.3433061!3e0">Route via Google Maps</a>.
