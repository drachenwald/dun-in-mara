Cruinniú is not the only event taking place in Ireland at this time. Our good friends in <a href="http://glenrathlin.org">Glen Rathlin</a> run Flaming Arrow every year on the May bank holiday weekend.

Flaming Arrow is the premier event in the Kingdom for archery, and is extremely popular with local and international attendees alike.

In 2020, Flaming Arrow will take place on the weekend of Friday 1st-Sunday 3rd May, in ASPIRE, Clara, the very same venue as Cruinniú.

If you're visiting Ireland for Cruinniú, why not come for both weekends? In Sweden, Finland, Germany and many other countries, the week between the events includes the May day bank holiday. It's an unrivalled chance to attend two popular events, and spend a few days relaxing and seeing the sights of Ireland in the meantime.

Booking is on the [Flaming Arrow Website](http://glenrathlin.org/flamingarrow/). Don't delay - it's very popular.

(Did we mention that the ASPIRE Centre has a <a href="http://www.clarahousespa.ie">Holistic Spa</a> right next door?)
