Dear friends,

We're sad to announce that we have to cancel Harvest Tavern.

You might remember this from our event announcement:

<div class="alert alert-primary">
Firstly, both we and the site will of course follow the government's health advice
at the time of the event. If this means that the event can't go ahead, then we will
cancel the event (with as much notice as we can give) and arrange refunds.
</div>

Unfortunately, the restrictions on gatherings announced by the Irish government on 18 August mean that we can't go ahead with the event.

You should receive a refund in the coming days, by the same means of payment that you used to book originally. If you've any questions about this, please drop a note to exchequer@duninmara.org.

It's a pity, but we're still glad we tried. We hope you are too.

And speaking of which â€“ we're going to give this one more spin before the year is out. We're planning for a small, local gathering at Martinstown House for the first weekend of October. If you're interested, take a look at our page for [an event, probably]({% link events/2020/an-event-probably/index.md %}).

In the meantime, stay safe, and stay well.

Sela, on behalf of the event team.
