title: Tavern Revel
---
On the 19th of May, the Shire of Dun in Mara invites you for a day of mirth and merriment at Drimnagh Castle, with an evening of Tavern entertainments.  While the daylight holds there will be opportunity to train in the art of swordplay, or for those of a less martial persuasion, to practice diverse arts such as dancing and stitching.  Afterwards, join us in the Tavern for an evening of feasting, singing, toasting our health, games and battles of wit, and miscellaneous merrymaking by candlelight.

**BOOKING IS ESSENTIAL.** Please see below for booking information.

We regret that the site is not wheelchair friendly due to a gravelled courtyard and tight/steep stairs.

## Planned Activities

**[TBC]**

If you have friends or relatives who are curious about what we do, but don’t want to commit to a full event, this is an ideal time for them to come along and have a look! 
Garb (medieval clothing) is required, but don’t worry if you haven’t got anything that looks medieval – just let us know during your booking! We can lend you something for the day if need be.

## Costs & Food

We are not charging any entry fee to the Tavern. Donations (there'll be a box or a jar) are very welcome, but we're much more interested in your presence than your money.

We will be operating a pot-luck for lunch and dinner. If you can bring something, please do. If you're not sure what kind of food to bring, contact Aodh at aodhosiadhail@gmail.com and he'll give you some guidelines.
