While we have practices and classes every week, we get together every couple of months for an event. These are usually over a weekend, and you can typically come for a day or stay and enjoy the whole thing. All meals are provided, including a lavish and tasty feast.

When at these events, we wear period garb - if you don't have any, that's ok, just let us know and we'll sort you out! We'll help you [live your best medieval life](https://mobile.twitter.com/Lin_Manuel/status/1027864394074484736?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw).

There are also other events across Ireland and Britain - see the [Principality Calendar](http://insulaedraconis.org/Events/) for details.
