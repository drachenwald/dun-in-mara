The Kingdom Fencing Marshal has announced that a new Fencing Rulebook and Marshals Handbook have been [published on the kingdom website](http://www.drachenwald.sca.org/drupal/content/kingdom-specific-regulations).

All fencers should familiarise themselves with the Rulebook, especially the updated requirements around hand protection for Cut and Thrust Fencing.

For Dun in Mara fencers who also do HEMA, your rolled tip is not sufficient here; it must be covered in order to do free play.

The Kingdom Fencing Marshal asks that marshals and marshals in training (MITS) read the new marshals handbook thoroughly. He would particularly like to highlight the need for marshals to ensure that their membership remains up to date.
