We're really looking forward to welcoming all our friends to Coronet of Fools in May. If, however, you need to cancel your booking, please let us know soon.

Cancellations will be handled per [Dun in Mara's cancellation policy](/about/cancellation) - you may cancel with a full refund up to two weeks before the event (and if there are any mitigating circumstances, please just let us know.)

For cancellations received _before the end of March_, we will process these and refund them by your original means of payment.

From the beginning of April:
- For cancellations requested between 1-25 April, we'll give a full refund after the event is complete.
- For cancellations requested 25 April-2 May, we'll give a 50% refund after the event is complete.
- From 3 May, bookings are nonrefundable.
