Friends, we have good news. We will gather again at the Cruinniú, this October.

Cruinniú Arís will take place **2-4 October 2020** at **Aspire House, Clara, Co. Offally**, the same venue as previously planned. We cannot express how eager we are to welcome you to Ireland.

And, best of all, despite all of the problems, Duke Sean has been able to rearrange his travel to join us and teach. We will run a full three day event, from Friday evening until Sunday evening, so that Duke Sean can teach his full workshop.

This event is only able to happen because of the kindness and generosity of the many people who donated and fundraised for us, so we are especially happy and grateful to be able to go ahead with the event, as originally planned, later in the year.

We will see you, once again, at Cruinniú.
