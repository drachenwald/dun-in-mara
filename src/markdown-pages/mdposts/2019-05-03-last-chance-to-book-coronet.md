It's Friday. You wish you were at an SCA event. Flaming Arrow is on right now, but you're missing it. Coronet of Fools is on next week, and it looks like it's going to be great - but is it too late to book the event and organise last minute travel? Not yet. The last day for booking is **SATURDAY 4th MAY**. You can still make it!
