We are thrilled with the response to Coronet of Fools! We'd like to point out that, as of 2nd Feb, we have family rooms, bunks, daytrip and camping spots still available. Details are on the [booking page](/events/2019/coronet/registration).

Thank you to everyone who booked last night; we hope it was a smooth experience. If you haven't seen it, we have a post on [why we did things this way](/mdposts/2019-01-30-coronet-why-this-way).
