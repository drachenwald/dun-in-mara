Fighters and dancers ahoy! Following last year’s successful introduction of the new fighting event in the Kingdom’s Calendar, Dun In Mara once more invites you to a weekend of the arts of war and the arts of peace, supported by the shire’s usual hearty hospitality. We warmly welcome all from outside our island who would wish to come cross swords with us, to dance with us, or to just make merry with us.

This year, we are particularly proud and pleased to welcome Sir Donngal de Buchanan and Mistress Iona Putnika, who are travelling from all the way from the Kingdom of Atenveldt (Arizona, USA) to teach at this event.
