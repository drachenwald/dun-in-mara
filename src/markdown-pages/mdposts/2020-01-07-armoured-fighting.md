Welcome back to another year of fighting fun. We are restarting on Thursday 9 January, at 19:00, at Bunscoil Sancta Maria, Synge Street, Dublin 2. If you have ever been interested in taking up armoured fighting or having a go, now is a fantastic time to come over and see if our sport might be for you. Your first time is free, afterwards we charge €10 per practice for non-members, €8 for members and €6 for unwaged.

For our old hands (but anyone really), we are starting monthly MELEE PRACTICES, which means that we will be practicing the tactics and techniques of team-on-team battles.

Our melee practice dates for the first quarter will be:

January 23  
February 6  
March 19
