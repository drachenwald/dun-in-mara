All the warriors of Dun In Mara and beyond are invited to come together for a Solstice Tourney on Thursday, 20 December to celebrate the season and what has been an excellently successful fighting year for the shire. The winner shall be crowned the shire's Lightbringer for the year. :) 

We will aim to start the tourney at our [usual venue in Synge Street](/armoured-fighting) at 19:30 and we trust it will not take longer than an hour. 

We will also warmly welcome anyone who wishes to come to watch and to cheer their champion. If I am told that any spectators will attend, I will even provide seasonal treats for their pleasure. 

If any MIT wishes to gain experience in tournament running, this would be a good time. 

In celebration & the joy of arms,  
Agnes, Knight Marshal
