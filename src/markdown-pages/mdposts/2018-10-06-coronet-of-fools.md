Bealtaine fires burn across the land, calling the Fair Folk out of their hiding places to witness the warriors of Insulae Draconis coming together to the ancient site of Newgrange to contest for the Coronet of the Isles.


The Shire of Dun in Mara is delighted to announce that Insulae Draconis Coronet will take place on the 10th-12th May near the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Newgrange in Irelandâ€™s Valley of Kings, by the Boyne River.

Dun In Mara invites all to a weekend of wonder and magic of Faerie:
