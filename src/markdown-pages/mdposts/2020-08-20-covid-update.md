With the restrictions announced by the Irish government this week, we've had to make changes to our plans.

We will cancel Harvest Tavern; Cruinniú is now planned to take place in 2021. If you booked for either of these events, check your mailbox. You should receive a refund by the same method of payment that you used to book originally. For more information, check the pages for [Harvest Tavern](/events/2020/harvest-tavern) and [Cruinniú Arís](/events/2020/cruinniu-aris).

We just recently restarted our Fencing practices; we're looking for a way to run them safely under the current circumstances, and we expect to have more news on this in the coming days.

Obviously, we're gutted to have to make these changes – we were especially looking forward to running our first events since COVID–19 hit. However, we have a lot still going on:

- We're tentatively planning [an event, probably](/events/2020/an-event-probably) as a small, local gathering for the weekend that Cruinniú Arís was scheduled.
- We're running virtual Armoured Fighting practice sessions and discussions every Thursday.
- We're planning an online event for later in the year (and our friends around Europe have [several online sessions a week](https://drachenwald.sca.org/events/calendar/))
- And we're still chatting on our [Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/113098955376605) and our [newly created Discord chat](https://discord.gg/vEds9Yj).

So stay safe, stay in touch, and one way or another, we'll see you soon.
