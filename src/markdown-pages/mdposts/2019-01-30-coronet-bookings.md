We are pleased to announce that bookings for Coronet of Fools will open on *Friday 1st February* at *20:00* GMT.

[Check this time in other timezones.](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html?iso=20190201T200000&p1=78&p2=37&p3=101)

We're doing booking differently this time: we have a lot of options so [please read the directions on the booking page carefully](/events/2019/coronet/registration) before proceeding to book.

In particular, we have special instructions if you wish to book a B&B room for two or more people. We are not booking individuals in B&B rooms at this event, but if you have someone to share with then you can book together.

We're using a ticket system called Fienta to handle registrations and payments for this event. They accept payment by Visa, Mastercard and bank transfer (in Euro). If you are unable to pay with these methods, please contact the reservation steward before you book; the contact is on [the booking page]({/events/2019/coronet/registration).

We have another post on [why we are doing things this way](/mdposts/2019-01-30-coronet-why-this-way).
