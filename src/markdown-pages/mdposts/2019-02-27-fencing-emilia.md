This week at fencing, we had a guest class from Emilia Skirmuntt of the School of the Sword, Oxford, assisted by Rob Williams of the Virtus Sword School, Cardiff. They ably ran us through a really interesting class, showing some of the strong connections between Fiore's unarmed, dagger and sword plays. We had a very good turnout and people really seemed to be having fun. Always great to cross-fertilise with other groups.
