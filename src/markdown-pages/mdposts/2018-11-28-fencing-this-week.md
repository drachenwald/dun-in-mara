For longsword this week, we drilled the basic exchange of thrusts until we are pretty sure we'll be able to do it in our sleep! :D

We also briefly looked at one of the counters, which we plan to practice more in later sessions. Cernac and I experimented with some avoidance exercises to practice range; as a bonus, I find that it also helps with not flinching during attacks.

The Rapier fencers refreshed the basics of Gigantis Rapier and moved on to cover the first  three feints. Next week we introduce daggers.
