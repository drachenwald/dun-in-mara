title: Code of Conduct

We are committed, in Dun in Mara and the SCA at large, to making sure that attendees
feel safe participating in the society. This policy has been approved by SCA Inc., and
appears in the Society Seneschals Handbook.

In addition to the people mentioned below, people in Dun in Mara or elsewhere in Insulae Draconis can contact the board members of the UK SCA CIC, detailed at [https://membermojo.co.uk/scauk/](https://membermojo.co.uk/scauk/). The Chair of the Board is Drew Shiel (Aodh Ó Siadhail), who can be contacted directly at [drewshiel@gmail.com](mailto:drewshiel@gmail.com).

## XXIV. SOCIETY SENESCHAL POLICIES & INTERPRETATIONS

### 4. Harassment and Bullying

The SCA prohibits harassment and bullying of all individuals and groups.
Harassment and bullying includes, but is not limited to the following:

- offensive or lewd verbal comments directed to an individual;
- the display of explicit images (drawn or photographic)
- depicting an individual in an inappropriate manner;
- photographing or recording individuals inappropriately to abuse or harass the individual;
- inappropriate physical contact; 
- unwelcome sexual attention; 
- or retaliation for reporting harassment and/or bullying.

Participants violating these rules are subject to appropriate sanctions. If an individual feels subjected to harassment, bullying or retaliation, they should contact a seneschal, President of the SCA, or the Kingdom’s Board Ombudsman. If a participant of the SCA becomes aware that someone is being harassed or bullied, they have a responsibility pursuant to the SCA Code of Conduct to come forward and report this behavior to a seneschal, President of the SCA or Kingdom’s Board Ombudsman.

The following statement must be posted at gate/troll at every SCA event in a size large enough for people to see it as they enter our events. This language must likewise be quoted in ALL site handouts at every event a site where a handout is made available.

> "THE SCA PROHIBITS HARASSMENT AND BULLYING OF ALL INDIVIDUALS AND GROUPS.
> Participants engaging in this behavior are subject to appropriate sanctions.
> If you are subjected to harassment, bullying or retaliation, or if you become aware
> of anyone being harassed or bullied, contact a seneschal, President of the SCA, or
> your Kingdom’s Board Ombudsman."
