You are welcome in Dun In Mara.

In Dun In Mara, we acknowledge that the richest, most fulfilling experiences are created when a diverse group of people come together to contribute their knowledge, enthusiasm, and different experiences. We also fully acknowledge that across history, in all periods and societies we wish to explore, there have been people of different sexualities, gender identities, and races, and to attempt to present a fully homogenous society would be not only detrimental to our Society but also ahistorical. Therefore, in Dun In Mara, we welcome people in all our activities regardless of their gender identity, sexual orientation, ethnicity, religion or any other background.  

Our members include gay, bisexual, non-binary and trans people, among others.  

Our international parent organisation, Society for Creative Anachronism (SCA), includes several internal interest groups, including an LGBT+ network called Clan Blue Feather. A symbol of this network is a blue feather, which some people choose to wear to demonstrate their membership or support of the group. 

In some of our tournaments, to embody the romantic Medieval idea of chivalry and courtesy, fighters are required to participate championing a non-fighting partner, known as “consort”. Often the consort is the fighter’s real life partner, but not always - a fighter may choose to champion a friend. It is possible for the fighter and the consort to be the same sex, and this happens regularly. 

Our martial arts practices and competitions do not segregate participants according to gender, and people of all genders not only practice but also compete together, against each other. In our arts and crafts, we have people of all genders enthusiastically participating in embroidery, costuming, calligraphy, cooking, and many other arts.

We welcome people with physical, neurological, and intellectual disabilities. We do not ask people who use assistive technology (such as glasses, hearing aids or wheelchairs) to remove, hide or disguise these in any way at our events. Across our groups in Ireland and elsewhere, we have members who have a wide variety of additional needs and as a group we work with each individual to ensure that they are able to get the most out of their experience in our Society.

The shire Seneschal and Officers are committed to making sure that all people in the group are able to participate in all activities and social occasions as fully respected and valued members of the group, without any harassment, bullying or humiliation, online or offline. All Dun In Mara events have a Code of Conduct and we require all attendees to adhere to this.
