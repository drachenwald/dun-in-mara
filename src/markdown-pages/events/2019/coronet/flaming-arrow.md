Coronet is not the only event taking place in Ireland in May. Our good friends in <a href="http://glenrathlin.org">Glen Rathlin</a> run Flaming Arrow every year on the May bank holiday weekend.

Flaming Arrow is the premier event in the Kingdom for archery, and is extremely popular with local and international attendees alike.

In 2019, Flaming Arrow will take place on the weekend of Friday 3rd-Sunday 5th of May. The venue is ASPIRE Centre in Clara, Co. Offaly, which is only 1h15m from Dublin, and 1h30m from Newgrange Lodge.

Visit the [Flaming Arrow Facebook event](https://www.facebook.com/events/414625759293936/?ti=ia) for more information, but hurry... it books out quickly!

If you're visiting Ireland for Coronet, why not come for both weekends? In the UK and many other countries, the week between the events includes the May day bank holiday. It's an unrivalled chance to attend two popular events, at super sites, and spend a few days relaxing and seeing the sights of Ireland in the meantime.

(Did we mention that the ASPIRE Centre has a <a href="http://www.clarahousespa.ie">Holistic Spa</a> right next door?)
