<i>"Over hill, over dale,  
Thorough bush, thorough brier,  
Over park, over pale,  
Thorough flood, thorough fire,  
I do wander everywhere,  
Swifter than the moon's sphere;  
And I serve the fairy queen,  
To dew her orbs upon the green.</i>

<i>“Shall we their fond pageant see?  
Lord, what fools these mortals be!”</i>

<i>― William Shakespeare, A Midsummer Night's Dream</i>

Bealtaine fires burn across the land, calling the Fair Folk out of their hiding places to witness the warriors of Insulae Draconis coming together to the ancient site of Newgrange to contest for the Coronet of the Isles.

Dun In Mara invites all to a weekend of wonder and magic of Faerie.

Please the Faerie King with your prowess on the field. Bring your best poetry and songs to gain the affection of the Faerie Queene. Don a mask for the feast and the evening revels, and wonder whether your table companion is a Sidhe or a mortal man. If you fear being taken to fairyland, fool the otherworldly guests by dressing up as one of them, so they may cast their desirous eyes elsewhere.

Location
--------

The Shire of Dun in Mara is delighted to announce that Insulae Draconis Coronet will take place on the 10th-12th May near the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Newgrange in Ireland’s Valley of Kings, by the Boyne River.

In the area
-----------

This area of Ireland is rich with history. While the event runs from Friday to Sunday, we think that this will be an excellent opportunity to extend your stay in Ireland and visit some of the other historical and medieval attractions that are close by - or come for the week and take in two events!
