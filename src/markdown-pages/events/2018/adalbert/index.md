title: The Feast of St. Adalbert II
---
### 23-25 March 2018
### Aspire Centre, Clara House, Clara, Co Offaly, Ireland

*It is the 16th Century. For the second year, the doors of a noble country house are thrown open to those who would come for food, for literary discussion, for music, and for good company.*

### This event is now _full._ Thank you for your interest.

This is quiet event with a little more authenticity in food and drink and presentation, with a slower pace than usual, as befits the country house of our imagination. There will be a full 16th century menu from Friday evening until Sunday morning, rather than a single feast. Our task is to cook, and cook some more; yours is to keep eating. Otherwise, the event will focus on socialising, for once having the time to talk to everyone you see at an event, and on A&S activities, particularly on stories, poetry, music, and the other arts. We encourage performances at any time of the day, particularly ad hoc ones. 

Our visiting teacher will be the Drachenwald Court Composer of two reigns: Lady Kaarina Eerikintytär from Aarnimetsä. 

You, too, may wish to offer or request relevant classes. Please note these in the booking form, and we will do our best to match requests and teachers.
 
No combat activities will be scheduled. If you wish to practice martial skills, you are welcome to do so provided that you find a willing marshal.  

Please note that due to the nature of the event, the attendee numbers will be limited. Book early to avoid disappointment, although we will operate a waiting list, if need be, and inform you accordingly. Dun In Mara cancellation policy applies, and will be enforced, particularly in the case of no-shows.
