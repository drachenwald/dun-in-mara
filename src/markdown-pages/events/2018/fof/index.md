### 1-4 June 2018

Passing from the cold of winter, to the cold of spring, we look with expectant eyes to the days of less cold and greater sunshine in summer. There, we can relax in the abundant comfort afforded by long, warm days and ample supplies. Whether you prefer to fight, feast, or further the creative arts, let your protective guard down and indulge in frivolous whimsy with Dun in Mara in June.

The event will run from 18:00 on Friday 1st of June until 14:00 on Monday 4th of June.  
[Dun In Mara cancellation policy](/about/cancellation.html) applies.
