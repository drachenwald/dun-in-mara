The site provides a variety of double, twin and family rooms. Two of the rooms are wheelchair accessible on the ground floor. All rooms are en suite.

Private rooms are €79 per person sharing; if you wish to book a double (or family) room, please book for both (all) members of your party in the same booking.

### Bunks

Newgrange Lodge has several rooms with comfortable bunk beds, which are available at a cheaper price than the private rooms.

Each dorm has an en suite toilet/shower. In the larger dorms, the shower room is separate. Bedding is provided.

Bunks are €55 per person.

Please note that both private rooms and dorms must be cleared by 11:00 on Sunday 18th June.

### Camping

Camping is allowed on site, and is charged at €50 per person.
