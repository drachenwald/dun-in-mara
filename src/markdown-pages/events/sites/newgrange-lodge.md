Events which take place in <a href="http://www.newgrangelodge.com/">Newgrange Lodge</a> are located just a moment&#8217;s walk from the <a href="http://www.heritageireland.ie/en/midlands-eastcoast/brunaboinnevisitorcentre/">Brú na Bóinne visitors centre</a>, which is the gateway to Newgrange. Newgrange is a passage tomb that was built during the Neolithic period around 3200 BC, and is older than Stonehenge and the Egyptian pyramids.

# Travel to Newgrange Lodge #

This venue is located just north-west of Dublin. If travelling by car, you can drive straight there; it&#8217;s motorways most of the way. To reach it via public transport, travel to the nearby town of Drogheda, and from there take a taxi, or take the <a href="http://www.buseireann.ie/timetables/163-1517477025.pdf">163 bus</a> (which runs twice a day.)

The train and bus stations in Drogheda <em>DO NOT</em> have taxi ranks. Booking ahead is recommended. If you like to use an app, the local taxis use [mytaxi](https://ie.mytaxi.com/). The site is 7.5km from Drogheda, and a taxi costs about €20.

### By air: Dublin Airport ###

The nearest airport is Dublin Airport, which has excellent connectivity all over Europe with low-cost airlines.

If you hire a car at Dublin Airport, you can drive straight to the site in just over 30 minutes. <a href="https://www.dublinairport.com/to-from-the-airport/car-rental">Car hire options at Dublin Airport</a>; <a href="https://www.google.ie/maps/dir/Dublin+Airport,+Collinstown,+Dublin/Newgrange+Lodge,+Meath/@53.5522181,-6.4649413,11z/am=t/data=!3m1!4b1!4m13!4m12!1m5!1m1!1s0x486711be6993192f:0x55121bb5b725f355!2m2!1d-6.2499098!2d53.4264481!1m5!1m1!1s0x4867389084780dd9:0xe7396a2113c1b9f7!2m2!1d-6.442805!2d53.694565">Route via Google Maps</a>. Note that this route has tolls, so please check with your car hire company how to pay for them.

The easiest public transport from the airport to Drogheda is to take Bus Éireann <a href="http://www.buseireann.ie/timetables/101-1515759575.pdf">Route 101 (timetable)</a> which picks up from the airport every 20-30 minutes and takes about 45 minutes. Book a taxi in advance to meet you in Drogheda, or arrange a pick-up.

### By car ferry: Dublin Port or Rosslare ###

If you are travelling by car from Great Britain, we recommend <a href="http://www.irishferries.com/ie-en/to-ireland-from-britain/">Irish Ferries</a> or <a href="http://www.stenaline.co.uk/ferries-to-ireland">Stena Line</a> between Holyhead and Dublin Port. Irish Ferries has a fast ferry (the Swift) which does the crossing in two hours; the cruise ferry (the Ulysses) takes three and a quarter hours, but is a smoother ride and more reliable in poorer weather.

Once you reach Dublin Port, you can drive straight off the ferry and to Newgrange Lodge in under 45 minutes. This route takes you via the Dublin Port Tunnel and the M1, both of which have tolls (and note that the [Port Tunnel tolls](https://www.dublintunnel.ie/toll-information) are quite high at peak times.) <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Dublin+Port,+Dublin/Newgrange+Lodge,+Staleen+Rd,+Stalleen,+Donore,+Co.+Meath/@53.5241831,-6.3248609,10z/data=!4m8!4m7!1m2!1m1!1s0x48670f049052bd5b:0x1800c7a937ea5790!1m2!1m1!1s0x4867389084780dd9:0xe7396a2113c1b9f7!3e0">Route via Google Maps</a>.

If you&#8217;re driving from southern Wales or the south of England, you may prefer to take a ferry to Rosslare from Pembroke (Irish Ferries) or Fishguard (Stena). The drive from Rosslare to Newgrange takes about two and a half hours, and also has tolls. <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Rosslare+Europort,+County+Wexford/Newgrange+Lodge,+Staleen+Rd,+Stalleen,+Donore,+Co.+Meath/@52.9717698,-6.4851166,8z/data=!4m8!4m7!1m2!1m1!1s0x486817429fe45625:0xc4364bd8334cd063!1m2!1m1!1s0x4867389084780dd9:0xe7396a2113c1b9f7!3e0">Route via Google Maps</a>.

### By Sail &amp; Rail from the UK: Dublin Port ###

If you are travelling by public transport from Britain, it is possible to get inexpensive Sail &amp; Rail tickets from any train station in Britain to any station in Ireland. The best information on how to book can be found at <a href="http://seat61.com/Ireland.htm">The Man In Seat 61</a>.

There are also coach services from <a href="https://eurolines.buseireann.ie/?returnUrl=_Timetable">Eurolines</a>, but these usually travel overnight.

### From Dublin city: train or bus ###

If you are travelling from Dublin city centre, you can travel to Drogheda by train or bus.

Trains leave from Dublin Connolly and take between 30 mins (non-stop) and one hour (commuter trains.) A return train ticket costs €25.70. Departure times may be found, and certain fast services may be booked in advance, on <a href="http://irishrail.ie">irishrail.ie</a>.

The two most convenient bus services are Bus Éireann <a href="http://www.buseireann.ie/timetables/100X-1516191057.pdf">Route 100X (timetable)</a> from Custom House Quay and <a href="http://www.buseireann.ie/timetables/101-1515759575.pdf">Route 101 (timetable)</a> from Talbot St. Both these locations are close to the central bus station, Busáras, and to Connolly train station. A return ticket costs €13.50, and the journey takes about an hour.
