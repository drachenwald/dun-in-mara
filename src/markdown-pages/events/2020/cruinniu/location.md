# Accommodation at Aspire #

Aspire can accommodate a reasonably sized group with relative privacy. Most rooms accommodate three people with a bunk bed plus an additional single bed, and are en suite.

For those staying in a bunk, bedding is provided. If you're staying in crash space, you need to bring your own sleeping bag and sleeping mat. Towels are not provided.

Crash space is available in a dry, heated portacabin, with a maximum of 10 places. You will need to bring your own camping bed or sleeping mat, and all the bedding. 

You may also camp mundanely or in a period manner, as you wish. There is no limit to this. 

Site opens at 18:00 on Friday and closes at **18:00 on Sunday** - we are planning a strong schedule into Sunday afternoon, so we encourage attendees to stay for the full day. Alcohol is allowed; please keep non-period containers covered.

Clara House Spa is situated across the courtyard, and provides massages, treatments and sauna facilities at extra cost. You can book these separately at [Clara House Spa](http://www.clarahousespa.ie/).
