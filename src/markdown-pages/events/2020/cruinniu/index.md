To arms once again! Your armoured sisters and brothers of Lough Devnaree invite you to celebrate the return of Spring by engaging in acts of tournament and war. A weekend all aspects of armoured combat, supported by the usual hearty hospitality of Dun In Mara & friends. Fighting is one of our passions in Lough Devnaree and we warmly welcome all from outside the island who would wish to come cross swords with us. 

This year, with immense pride, our visiting teacher will be none other than **Duke Sean Kirkpatrick Tarragon** (MKA Sean Oppenheimer) from Artemisia, a Knight of the Society for more than 32 years. He is one of the preeminent trainers of SCA combat in the Known World today. He specializes in training the trainer, training methodology, teaching fighting analysis and video review. He has been training fighters all around the globe for more than 15 years and has taught his specific fighting clinic in more than half of the Kingdoms.

Duke Sean will be teaching his fighting clinic on Saturday and Sunday. **We have extended our usual site booking until 18:00 on Sunday, so please take this into account in planning your travel.**
